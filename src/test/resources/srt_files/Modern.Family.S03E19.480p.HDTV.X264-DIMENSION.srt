1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,520
Councilwoman Dunphy, how do you respond

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,880
to allegations that you look super sexy in your new suit?

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,690
Uh, I haven't been elected yet.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,950
Come on, kids! We gotta vote!

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,280
- Honey, come on. Please stop filming. - I'm just excited!

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,740
After today, you are going to be a councilwoman,

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,110
and I am going to be a first husband.

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,240
And if you don't stop filming,

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,230
you're going to be my first husband.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,470
All right, everybody, come on!

11
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,990
Do you know what you're doing, kids?

12
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,190
You guys are manning the phone banks.

13
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,320
Alex, you're in charge of that.

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,950
Wh-why is she in charge? And what's--what's a phone bank?

15
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,220
That's why.

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,440
- Phil. - I got it.

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,430
I will be driving 50 of our finest senior citizens to the polls,

18
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,580
assuming, of course, that they remember that I'm coming for them.

19
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,300
- Where you at? - High-five.

20
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
Old people occasionally forget things.

21
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,840
Okay. All right, everybody, let's go. Let's go.

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,070
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Real quick!

23
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,600
Sorry. Everybody get in there. Jump in there.

24
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,750
I just want to say how proud of you we all are.

25
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,140
You're an inspiration.

26
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,020
Who would have thought that 20 years ago

27
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,630
when you were still in the bloom of your youth--

28
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,310
Okay, I'm gonna go start the car.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,340
Claire likes to win.

30
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,420
When she was 8, a little girl scout friend of hers

31
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,480
bragged she could sell the most cookies.

32
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,580
Damn if Claire didn't walk the neighborhood

33
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,970
till she got blisters on her feet and won by ten boxes.

34
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,210
Best part is

35
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,480
Claire wasn't even a girl scout.

36
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,180
The choice is Claire!

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,260
Vote Claire Dunphy for town council.

38
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,210
Aw, I love it!

39
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,770
- What do you think, huh? - I love it.

40
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,590
We got it on Craigslist.

41
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,850
Came off a taco truck.

42
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,800
- It did. - I love that you're doing this for me.

43
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,570
- Thank you! - You're welcome.

44
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,800
I know how important winning is to Claire.

45
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,500
And I love to festoon things.

46
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,670
We're her dream team.

47
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,590
So we cleared the whole day, dropped Lily off at school,

48
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,900
and voted first thing.

49
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,960
Although, uh, one of us had a bit of a dimpled chad situation.

50
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,750
Can you tell me how this machine works again, Chad?

51
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,230
Oh, sure. No problem.

52
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,270
Just wanna look in here. Just--

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,650
Thank you. Thank you.

54
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,870
- Bye! Bye!- Thank you, guys!

55
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,260
I can see Clairely now that Duane is gone.

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,560
Bye! Thank you! Oh, my gosh.

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,450
Okay, everybody, get in the car. Let's go. Let's go.

58
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,660
Good luck today, Claire.

59
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,290
Oh, Laurie, thank you.

60
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,010
Hey, by the way, we have some really good news.

61
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,220
- What's that? - Becky got into the University of Oregon.

62
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,990
Oh, congratulations!

63
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,130
Any news, Haley?

64
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,720
Uh, uh, no, not-- not yet,

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,570
but, you know, super psyched!

66
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,240
This whole waiting-to-hear thing has been a nightmare

67
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,000
since the very first letter.

68
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm too nervous. I can't do it.

69
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,510
"Dear miss Dunphy,

70
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,380
we regret to inform you..."

71
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,250
What?! Don't leave me hanging!

72
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,330
After that, I decided to only tell my parents good news.

73
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,620
I have one school left,

74
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,110
and the only good news I've gotten

75
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,360
is that my annoying neighbor Becky

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,290
is moving back east to Oregon.

77
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,280
- Manny, write this down. - I didn't bring a pen.

78
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,330
Election day is America at its finest.

79
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,790
The people speak, and the government listens.

80
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,060
I don't know what they do in Colombia.

81
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,330
No one does, and don't ask.

82
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,850
I mean, we know that voting's a privilege,

83
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,870
but for my daughter to have her name on that ballot,

84
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,500
it just means so much more--

85
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,090
You know what? I think I'm gonna vote later.

86
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,360
What? Where are you going?

87
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,910
Ah, the line is too long.

88
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,340
It's only three people! And nobody has a gun!

89
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,930
We're here, we're Claire,

90
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,490
get used to it!

91
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,200
You know, I'm not sure if that's tracking.

92
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,480
Here, let me try one.

93
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,820
You don't have to be Clairevoyant to know who to vote for.

94
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,380
Vote Dunphy for town council.

95
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,390
Uh, uh, uh, Claire Dunphy.

96
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,570
Uh, C-Caire's her first name.

97
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,870
I'm sorry if that wasn't Claire.

98
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,260
Oh, my God. Look at that. There's a trash can right there,

99
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,030
and that guy just threw his paper on the sidewalk.

100
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,340
Hey! You in the yellow jacket.

101
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,800
Pick it up and put it in the trash.

102
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,040
- Oh, my God. He did it. - Yes, he did.

103
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,200
Ooh, here. Let me try one.I'll try...

104
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,100
Hey, dragon tattoo, no jaywalking!

105
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,360
oh, my gosh.

106
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,220
This is an instrument of power.

107
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,390
How could they not sell tacos?

108
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,960
You know what we could do with this thing?

109
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,460
Cam, we could really make a difference.

110
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,020
We could be the voice of change.

111
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,310
Ooh, I got it!

112
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,800
Let's go yell at the dry cleaner that lost my shirt.

113
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,060
Come on, gang.

114
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,540
Today is the Dunphys at their best.

115
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm from the "Weekly Saver." Mind if I ask you

116
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,430
- a couple questions about the big election? - Not at all.

117
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,620
Fire away.

118
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,110
Who are you voting for today?

119
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,260
Claire Dunphy.

120
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,300
Finally. I've been waiting for someone to say that name.

121
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,260
Why?

122
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,780
Uh... Because I am Claire Dunphy.

123
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,700
Oh, sorry. They moved me over from ad sales.

124
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,720
We take turns reporting.

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,410
How do you feel about your chances today?

126
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,440
Not as good as I did a few minutes ago.

127
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,780
No, she feels great.

128
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,550
Um, her spirits are high. The whole family's high.

129
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,360
- There's your headline. - Phil, no.

130
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,600
Uh, how about a photo of all of you?

131
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,630
- Yeah. Sure. Yes. - Mom, mom, mom. Tag.

132
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,580
- Tag's still on. - Oh, my Goodness.

133
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,120
Thank you.

134
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,850
That would have been a really awkward picture. Okay.

135
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,860
No!

136
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,610
What is that?

137
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,630
Is that a tooth?

138
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,010
- Ew! - Awesome!

139
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,270
How old are you? No!

140
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,960
- Do it again! - How does that even happen?

141
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,750
It's a-a fake tooth from an old ice-skating injury.

142
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,690
- It just fell out. - Oh, my gosh. Why today?!

143
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,940
- What about the... - Let's not overreact.

144
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,000
- Let's--let me see it. - Okay. All right.

145
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,810
Got it. Thanks.

146
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,600
What happened back there?

147
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,510
Line was too long. I couldn't wait.

148
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,430
I've seen you wait 45 minutes in line for sherbet!

149
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,360
Well, I happen to like sherbet, okay?

150
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,820
That place I take you

151
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,400
has the greatest sherbet on the west coast.

152
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,230
They got lime sherbet, they got coconut sherbet.

153
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,370
Why are we talking about sherbet?

154
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,710
He's clearly changing the subject.

155
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,820
Why aren't you in school?

156
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,070
He's doing it again.

157
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,860
Manny's right. You're being very ardilla.

158
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,850
- "Ardilla"? - Yeah, you know, the--

159
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,520
The one that--that--

160
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,850
- Rabbit? I was being rabbit-y? - No, another one

161
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,800
- With the cheeks and the tail and... - Chipmunk?

162
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,860
- Possum? -Okay, obviously she means squirrel.

163
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,960
You were being squirrely then,

164
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,080
- You're being squirrely now. - Better than being a rat.

165
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,060
Manny, give us a minute.

166
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,600
Oh, sure. I served him up on a silver platter.

167
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,600
What?

168
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:31,960
All right, it's no big deal.

169
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,350
There was a woman working there.

170
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,530
I didn't want her to see me.

171
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,410
- Who is she? - Her name is Dottie.

172
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,710
She's the first woman I dated after my divorce.

173
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,980
You dated a Dottie after Dede?

174
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,500
Y-you're focusing on the wrong thing here.

175
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,560
The--the point is it ended badly.

176
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,990
I tried to let her down easy, but, uh,

177
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,910
she didn't take it too well.

178
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,330
Actually, I don't know how she took it,

179
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,780
'cause I wasn't there.

180
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,880
We dated a few weeks, then after we... You know,

181
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,490
I slipped out of her house before she woke up

182
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,790
and never called her again.

183
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,500
Put my pants on in her yard, put the car in neutral,

184
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,410
let it roll down the driveway, lights off.

185
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,110
Hey, I can't talk about this anymore.

186
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:08,430
So because of this woman,

187
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,370
you didn't vote for your daughter?

188
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,780
It's Claire! We need her to win!

189
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,990
I don't want to be around when something that tight comes unraveled.

190
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,060
I'll figure out something.

191
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,830
Maybe those poll workers take shifts.

192
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,540
Stop hiding in your little cave like a--

193
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,870
Like, you know. Like the-- the--the--

194
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,160
- I really don't wanna do this again. - No, the--

195
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,450
No. No. The big one, like, uh, the monster furry one.

196
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,440
Ay, why can't I remember any animal names?

197
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,260
Climb aboard the Dunphy Express.

198
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,730
Next stop--democracy.

199
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,970
- Well--no, no... - Please don't go.

200
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,710
I won't do that anymore. I promise.

201
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,480
Oh. Uh, we need to make a quick stop.

202
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,770
I gotta pick up my new glasses.

203
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,360
No can do. I, uh...

204
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,180
I got a lot of people waitin', so...

205
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,950
It'll just take two minutes.

206
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,530
I can't even see the ballot without my glasses.

207
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,870
I mark the wrong box,

208
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,920
next thing you know I'll be married to a guy.

209
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,490
Yeah, I-- I don't think it's mandatory, Walt.

210
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm a good dancer. They'll come for me.

211
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,300
Oh, yeah.

212
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,330
They will break all your buttons...

213
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,410
and say you brought it in that way.

214
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,690
Okay, go, go, go!

215
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,650
Turns out we had a lot of axes to grind.

216
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,990
And a hybrid, so there was virtually no stopping us.

217
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,000
Do not see that movie!

218
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,420
You will neither laugh nor cry!

219
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,540
"Best pizza in the city"?

220
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,620
Not even the best pizza on this street.

221
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,880
They do not do the hair of the people on those pictures!

222
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,480
"Totally free checking"?

223
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,860
Don't bank on it!

224
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,410
Okay, that was really fun,

225
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,570
But now we gotta go back to campaigning for Claire.

226
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,930
We've been saying that for two hours.

227
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,800
Yes, but now I-I really mean it.

228
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,040
- Oh, my god, there's Sandy! - Sandra Bullock?

229
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,290
Yeah, Sandra Bullock.

230
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,230
We're such good friends, I call her "Sandy," So...

231
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,480
No, Sandy who works at Lily's preschool.

232
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,370
- Right there. - Oh, yeah.

233
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,470
- You know, she got engaged. - No!

234
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,580
- To the gay boyfriend? - Totally.

235
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,480
Oh, how does she not see it?

236
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,580
If I was with somebody that gorgeous,

237
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,060
I'd overlook a few quirks, too.

238
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,320
First of all, thank you.

239
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,610
Second of all...

240
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,840
point well taken.

241
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,810
I don't know. Poor Sandy. I feel so bad for her.

242
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,750
- Well, it's better than being alone. - Is it?

243
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,040
She's looking over here.

244
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,030
- Oh, my god. - Mitchell, you're sitting on the button.

245
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,730
What? No--no, I'm not. No, I'm not!

246
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,090
The--it's stuck!

247
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,000
And you're the one that had it last

248
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,810
- when you were talking to the cheese shop! - Because you know what?

249
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,190
If you advertise truffle cheese,

250
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,650
- there are certain expectations... - Hi, Sandy.

251
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,620
Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Claire Dunphy.

252
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,520
- What a beautiful name. - She used to be a citizen.

253
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,470
I'm calling on behalf of Claire Dunphy for town council.

254
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,200
All right. How about this?

255
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,890
if you vote for Claire Dunphy...

256
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,670
You won't have to pay taxes for the rest of your life.

257
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,950
Vote for Claire!

258
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,640
Luke! What are you doing?

259
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,550
You can't say that!

260
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,680
Oh, like she'd be the first politician

261
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,400
to make a promise she can't keep.

262
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,830
Well, maybe I don't want to talk to you, either.

263
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,940
Maybe you are the one that is bothering me!

264
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,310
How do you like that? Eh?

265
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,980
Gloria, I'm gonna have to ask you again

266
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,630
to please stick to your script.

267
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,310
But everybody's saying no to me!

268
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,370
I don't get it.

269
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,200
Usually when I ask someone to do something,

270
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
they just do it!

271
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,510
Maybe it's because these people can't see you.

272
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,720
I don't like it.

273
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,270
Can't you just hook me up to some sort of camera?

274
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,310
Well, thank you, Maggie, for the vote.

275
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,580
Okay. Bye-bye.

276
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,990
Here's your seat.

277
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,060
Thank you. Um, you'll have to excuse me.

278
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,680
I'm a little nervous. I've never been on the radio before.

279
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,800
Don't worry about it.

280
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,250
- Just think of it as a conversation. - Okay.

281
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,530
Here are your headphones. Volume control.

282
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,510
- Don't get too far from the mike. - Okay.

283
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,000
Make sure your cell phone's off.

284
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,480
Oh. Cell phone. Right. Um...

285
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,840
And you're not chewing gum, are you?

286
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,240
No, I'm not. I just had some temporary

287
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,950
dental work done.

288
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,250
The last thing I need--

289
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,210
And welcome back to "A matter of record."

290
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm Cecil Van Gundy.

291
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,540
Joining us now in studio is district 43

292
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,110
town council candidate Claire Dunphy.

293
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,870
Thank you, Cecil.

294
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,410
It's a pleasure to be here.

295
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,700
So... You're a first-time candidate.

296
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,310
Tell us what got you involved.

297
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,490
It all started with a, um...

298
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,950
With a stop sign.

299
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,050
I was concerned about safety in our neighbourhood

300
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,760
and I was not getting any satisfaction from city hall.

301
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,270
What's wrong with mom?

302
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,450
Oh, this isn't good.

303
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,200
She sounds drunk!

304
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,690
That's not her drunk voice.

305
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,250
Tell us about some of the other issues facing our town.

306
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,510
Where do you stand on the city's

307
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,510
sewage and sustainability initiative,

308
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,010
the so-called S.S.I.?

309
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,840
One cannot really talk about

310
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,150
s-s-sewage and sustainability

311
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:35,500
without first discussing... recycling.

312
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,480
This city can do more...

313
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,050
- What the hell's wrong with her? - with the recycling program...

314
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,130
She sounds drunk!

315
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:42,080
- ...currently... - It's a tooth thing.

316
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:43,880
What's wrong?

317
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,830
Oh, I'm almost out of air. Oh, boy.

318
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,100
Is that serious?

319
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,280
Is oxygen serious?

320
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,640
You know what? I lost a ton of time getting your glasses.

321
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,900
I'm just gonna drop you at home.

322
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,110
You can get your air. I can drive other people.

323
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,270
I don't have any more tanks at home.

324
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,250
Why? That seems like bad planning.

325
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,720
Well, I forgot to order them.

326
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,030
My pills make me forget things.

327
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,390
Oh, shoot! I gotta take my pill!

328
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,670
Please tell me you have it with you.

329
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,930
Of course I do, but I have to take 'em with food.

330
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,800
- Don't I? - Are you asking me?

331
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,690
Uh, yes! I do take them with food!

332
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,000
Ooh. I don't feel so well.

333
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,750
Okay, I'll get you whatever you want!

334
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,870
I'll get you the air, I'll get you the food.

335
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,550
Then I'll vote for your drunk wife.

336
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,460
That is not her drunk voice!

337
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,600
Thank you so much for voting.

338
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,930
We appreciate it.

339
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,620
Hi. I'm terribly sorry. Excuse me. Jay Pritchett.

340
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,470
Uh, can I get in-- in and out really quick?

341
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,230
Thank you. This is all I needed.

342
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,790
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

343
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,570
All right. Claire, Claire, Claire.

344
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,760
Claire, Claire-- ahh, ahh. Here.

345
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

346
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,180
Hello, Dottie!

347
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,510
Jay! It's so nice to see you!

348
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,980
- Is it? - Oh, why wouldn't it be?

349
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,780
That was a long time ago. Water under the bridge.

350
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,610
- We're good. - Oh, that's great.

351
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,020
Thank you so much for voting.

352
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,050
You remember my daughter Claire. She's--

353
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,570
She's running for town council.

354
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,750
- Oh, isn't that neat? - Yeah, I'm so proud.

355
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,780
So you're gonna put it in there, huh?

356
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,230
Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah. Definitely.

357
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,390
cause every vote counts, you know.

358
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,470
Thank you so much for voting.

359
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,320
- You know... - Yeah.

360
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,490
Boy, I'd sure like to see the sweet sight

361
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,220
of my vote... counting.

362
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,930
Why would I say I'd do something and not do it?

363
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,540
That would make me a liar...

364
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,610
instead of a trusting widow

365
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,620
Who fell asleep in the warm embrace

366
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,730
of a man who promised to make breakfast.

367
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,310
Okay, here it is.

368
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,580
Look, I am so sorry.

369
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,480
You were the first woman I'd been with besides my ex--

370
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,810
35 years.

371
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,080
I panicked.

372
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,640
An-and it wasn't 'cause y-you weren't pretty naked

373
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,700
or anything like that.

374
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,310
I'd have run from Angie Dickinson.

375
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,140
- Oh, lucky her. - Dottie--

376
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,760
- Good-bye, Jay! - Dottie, Dottie, please.

377
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,460
I'm just trying to get my ballot in the box.

378
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,040
oh, yeah, that sounds familiar.

379
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,780
Yeah, but you don't have to do anything.

380
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,290
Just let me put it in!

381
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,770
Uhh. Shouldn't have said that.

382
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,940
We are so sorry.

383
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,880
We did not mean for you to hear any of that.

384
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:16,510
Yes, and you know what?

385
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,500
We shouldn't have been gossiping in the first place.

386
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,390
But what if you're right?

387
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,550
What if Gregory is gay?

388
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,280
When my mom said it, I didn't believe her.

389
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,030
She lives in Iowa.

390
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,330
But coming from you two!

391
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:26,500
- Means nothing. - No.

392
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,340
We barely know your fiance.

393
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,360
- If he says he's straight, he's straight. - Mm. Straight.

394
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,820
We're getting married in a month.

395
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,050
People are flying in.

396
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,540
He signed us up for dance classes.

397
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,600
Oh, my god!

398
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,330
No. No, no, no. Hey.

399
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,650
- This is what gays do. - Yeah.

400
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,760
- We gossip. - We gossip a lot.

401
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,970
He gossips!

402
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,180
No. No. You're missing the point, okay?

403
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,000
We see a great-looking guy like Gregory,

404
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,830
and we say he's gay because we want him to be gay!

405
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,810
- Really? Really? Are you sure? - Yes. Yes.

406
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,000
Absolutely. Look at what we do with movie stars.

407
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,440
Okay.

408
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,770
You know? Hugh Jackman-- he sings, he dances,

409
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,050
He's dreamy!

410
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,110
So obviously we would want him on our team!

411
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,490
- Yeah. - But he's straight.

412
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,420
Trust me, I know.

413
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,270
I said hello to him once in a restaurant,

414
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,940
and there was absolutely no chemistry.

415
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,830
Well, if that isn't proof...

416
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,540
Three weeks later, Sandy and Gregory got married,

417
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,750
and everyone said the wedding was beautiful.

418
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,560
Gregory did the flowers....

419
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,910
Which is perfectly normal for a straight guy.

420
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,670
The Greeks do one thing right, and it's lamb!

421
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:27,410
All right. Let's go vote.

422
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,150
Why the hell does your wife want to be a politician, anyway?

423
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,870
You heard her. She wanted to put up

424
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,570
a stop sign at Bristol and Greenleaf,

425
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,480
But then she ran into--

426
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,220
Wait, wait, wait!

427
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,720
That's near where I live!

428
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,930
Yeah. We're neighbors. Let's go!

429
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,810
No way I'm voting for that!

430
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,610
Too much government already.

431
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,620
I didn't fight a war so some politician

432
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,220
could tell me where I have to stop my car.

433
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,800
You don't even drive!

434
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,410
That's 'cause that Barack Obama took my license away.

435
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,620
I don't think he was involved in the decision!

436
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,510
I left the house today to get 50 votes for my wife.

437
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,720
I'm not going home with zero.

438
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,140
The least you can do is walk right in there

439
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,490
and punch a hole for the woman

440
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,310
who drags your garbage can up your driveway every Tuesday!

441
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,920
I don't like it! Goes against everything I believe in.

442
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,800
Really? A stop sign?!

443
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,130
But I'll do it, 'cause you're a good kid.

444
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,280
And I had a nice day...

445
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,910
till you started yelling at me.

446
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,780
So sorry. Thank you.

447
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,200
Here you go.

448
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,320
You know, my wife was an alcoholic, too.

449
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,770
Okay. Let's just go vote.

450
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,370
That's veteran political reporter

451
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,950
Walter Shapiro.

452
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,790
Hi, everyone!

453
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,990
- Any news? - Not yet, not yet,

454
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,990
But even if I lose, at least now I know

455
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,880
I have a future in radio.

456
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,820
I couldn't. People need to see me.

457
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,790
Before we get the results, I just want to thank you all

458
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,940
for everything you've done for me.

459
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,510
Mitch and Cam, for campaigning for me all day

460
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,260
in your little Claire-mobile.

461
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,940
- It's the least we could do. - Yeah.

462
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,960
Literally.

463
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,810
We probably did more for Hugh Jackman's career

464
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,260
than we did for Claire's.

465
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,110
And, Manny and Gloria,

466
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,900
thank you for making all those phone calls.

467
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,040
And, dad...

468
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,670
for all your support.

469
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,500
I don't think I convinced anyone to vote for Claire.

470
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,210
I don't think I even voted.

471
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,390
And my husband...

472
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,090
who drove around

473
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:20,830
I don't know how many senior citizens today to the polls.

474
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,800
One.

475
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,220
And my beautiful children,

476
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,120
whose faith has given me the confidence

477
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,260
to believe that I can do this.

478
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,160
I can--oh.

479
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,760
- Somebody else answer it. I lost. - Mom. Mom.

480
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,390
- I can feel it. I-- - Mom.

481
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,320
You can do it. Mom. Answer the phone.

482
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,040
Hello?

483
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,520
This is she.

484
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,660
Thanks so much for calling.

485
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,960
Bye-bye.

486
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,880
I have some bad news.

487
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,690
Because someone's gonna be busy now that she's a councilwoman?

488
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,870
No, no, I wasn't doing that fake thing.

489
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,990
- I really lost. I lost. - Ay, no.

490
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,750
I'm so sorry. But you know what?

491
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,130
We are still just so proud of you.

492
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,320
Yeah! I-- I don't know about you,

493
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
But, um... I could use a glass of wine.

494
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,890
Ohh. Now you're gonna hear her drunk voice.

495
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,530
Mom?

496
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,430
You okay?

497
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,290
Yes. Fine. I'm good.

498
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,250
I'm fine. I'm not fine. I wanted to win,

499
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,200
And... and I'm so embarrassed.

500
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,340
I mean, everybody out here worked so hard for me,

501
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,320
and they believed in me,

502
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,890
and I let 'em down.

503
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,280
Oh, honey.

504
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,510
Oh, sweetheart.

505
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,070
Well, don't cry. I'm gonna be fine, sweetie.

506
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,470
Really, I am.

507
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,940
Just knowing you care so much makes me feel better.

508
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,030
No, I got four rejection letters

509
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,070
I never told you guys about.

510
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,220
What?

511
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,170
I got rejected from U.C.S.B., Oregon, Wisconsin...

512
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,540
- Oh, no. - And Northwestern.

513
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,840
Well, we were overshooting on that one.

514
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,560
What about, uh...

515
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,730
It came today. My last chance.

516
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,290
I'm too scared to open it.

517
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,320
Whatever it says in there,

518
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,360
your father and I are crazy proud of you.

519
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,530
Okay?

520
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,450
I did start trying this year.

521
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,320
I know you did. You did.

522
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,120
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

523
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,330
Neither do you.

524
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:47,690
It's a little bit different.

525
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,640
No, it's exactly the same.

526
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,570
Except you tried really hard the whole time,

527
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,920
not just at the end.

528
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,930
You're right.

529
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,210
It is the same.

530
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,440
We have nothing to be ashamed of...

531
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,740
So let's open that together.

532
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,710
Yeah, open it.

533
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,630
What? No! What are you doing here?

534
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,800
No. Come on, haley. We believe in you.

535
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,650
Do it!

536
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,430
You can always work for me.

537
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,200
Come on. You can do it. You can do this.

538
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,090
- Come on, Haley. - All right.

539
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,660
Open. Open, open, open.

540
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,570
"Dear Miss Dunphy,

541
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:24,800
We regret to inform you..."

542
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,990
Oh, honey.

543
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,820
"While we cannot offer you admission at this time,

544
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,000
"You are a promising candidate, and therefore

545
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,580
We would like to place you on our wait list!"

546
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,220
Oh, my god, I got wait-listed!

547
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,620
We will take it!

548
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,300
Yeah!

549
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,480
Congratulations! Congratulations!

550
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,250
Our daughter might be going to college!

551
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,360
Phil, look.

552
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,930
A stop sign.

553
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,800
It's addressed to you.

554
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,560
"Dear Claire, I won. You lost.

555
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,230
"Here's your stupid stop sign.

556
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,730
"Next time you think about bothering me,

557
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,500
"Please take its advice.

558
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,850
Your councilman, the honorable Duane Bailey."

559
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,790
Honey, you did it!

560
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,770
I did it.

561
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,030
I made our neighborhood a little bit safer.

562
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,320
I may have even saved life.

563
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,770
You idiot, there's stop sign! Can't you read?

564
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,070
we need speed bumps.

565
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,190
No, no. No! Honey!
