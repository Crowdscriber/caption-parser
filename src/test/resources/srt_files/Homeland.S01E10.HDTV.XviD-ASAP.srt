PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces</i> <i>of the United States</i>

3
00:00:08,364 --> 00:00:11,165
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

4
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,163
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed</i>
<i>into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

5
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:14,631
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned</i>
<i>acts of terror</i>

6
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:17,309
<i>in Africa, Europe,</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

7
00:00:17,343 --> 00:00:19,912
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not stand,</i>
<i>this</i> <i>aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

8
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:21,680
<i>REAGAN:</i> <i>This relentless
pursuit</i> <i>of terror.</i>

9
00:00:21,714 --> 00:00:23,320
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

10
00:00:23,355 --> 00:00:24,827
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

11
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:26,029
<i>while refueling</i>
<i>in the port of Aden.</i>

12
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:27,999
This was an act of terrorism.

13
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:30,505
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

14
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,843
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

15
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:34,013
is one of the good old
favorites.

16
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:36,618
Until something stops him.

17
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:39,456
WOMAN: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

18
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,063
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

19
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:46,701
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

20
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:50,408
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

21
00:00:50,442 --> 00:00:52,642
(speaking Arabic)

22
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:59,486
SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,489
God!

24
00:01:01,524 --> 00:01:03,492
CARRIE: <i>Fuck! I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

25
00:01:03,526 --> 00:01:06,297
<i>I won't...</i> <i>I</i> can't
<i>let that happen again.</i>

26
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:09,734
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

27
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:11,436
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

28
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,437
CARRIE:
<i>Everyone's not me.</i>

29
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,984
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

30
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:27,485
You're telling me
the fucking CIA

31
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,153
thinks I'm working for al-Qaeda?

32
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:32,423
<i>I</i> think you're working
for al-Qaeda.

33
00:01:32,457 --> 00:01:34,091
We were wrong about Brody.

34
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,294
<i>Wait!</i>

35
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:37,629
I was-I was wrong.

36
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,665
This weekend, this time
that we spent together,

37
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,835
it was real.

38
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:44,205
Hey, Carrie, fuck you.

39
00:01:48,144 --> 00:01:50,446
I pray every day that you never

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,148
lose sight of what
you committed to do

41
00:01:52,182 --> 00:01:54,484
in Issa's name.

42
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,053
This is Issa, my son.

43
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:57,822
I want him to learn English.

44
00:01:57,856 --> 00:02:00,892
"The house must be strong
to keep them safe."

45
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:02,929
That's truly excellent.

46
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:07,868
WALDEN: <i>A drone missile hit and</i>
<i>destroyed part of a compound</i>

47
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:09,204
<i>in the mountains</i>
<i>of Northern Iraq.</i>

48
00:02:09,238 --> 00:02:10,672
<i>The images being broadcast</i>

49
00:02:10,706 --> 00:02:12,407
<i>of the bodies</i>
<i>of 83 dead children</i>

50
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:14,143
<i>allegedly killed in the strike,</i>

51
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:17,214
<i>we believe to be false,</i>

52
00:02:17,248 --> 00:02:19,183
created by the terrorists
for propaganda purposes.

53
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:20,885
The vice president--
the man most instrumental

54
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,755
in the drone attack
that killed young Issa--

55
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:26,825
is going to ask you to run
for political office.

56
00:02:26,859 --> 00:02:31,497
Say yes. That will be a signal
to Nazir that you are

57
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,933
still committed to do this.

58
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,568
Aileen just ID'd Tom Walker.

59
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:37,570
<i>He's the terrorist.</i>

60
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,038
Tom was dead.
That's what they told me.

61
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,107
CARRIE:
<i>What we need to do is find him</i>

62
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,609
<i>before anything happens.</i>

63
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:47,113
ZAHIRA: <i>Walker-- he meets</i>
<i>with a man to do business.</i>

64
00:02:47,147 --> 00:02:49,382
He drives a car
with the diplomatic plates.

65
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:53,052
SAUL: <i>That's it on the left--</i>
<i>home of our Saudi diplomat.</i>

66
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,922
What if Mr. Zahrani doesn't give
us anything anytime soon?

67
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:59,693
We'll figure out an elegant way
to lift and interrogate him.

68
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:09,237
(saxophone playing jazz riff)

69
00:03:13,242 --> 00:03:15,611
SAUL: <i>What do we know?</i>
<i>Very little, that's what.</i>

70
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:17,112
<i>But in our line of work,</i>

71
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:19,481
<i>sometimes very little</i>
<i>is just enough.</i>

72
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:21,049
<i>Take Mansoor Al Zahrani.</i>

73
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:22,418
<i>Mild-mannered second secretary</i>

74
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,486
of the Saudi embassy.

75
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,555
Seen here going to work
three days ago.

76
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,490
We surveilled him 24/7.

77
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:31,226
We've listened to every phone
call he's made in the last week.

78
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,461
We pawed through
his professional life,

79
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:35,764
his financial life,
his personal life.

80
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:39,168
In short, we turned him upside
down and we shook real hard.

81
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:40,803
Two items of interest fell out.

82
00:03:40,838 --> 00:03:42,472
Item one--

83
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:46,309
Al Zahrani's in debt to the
tune of about $750,000,

84
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:48,980
all due to investments even
I'd know better than to make.

85
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:50,114
Item two--

86
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:53,318
Al Zahrani's gay.

87
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:55,254
He's got three wives,

88
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:56,422
ten children.

89
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:58,658
He's a devout and
conscientious Muslim.

90
00:03:58,692 --> 00:03:59,792
Yet, every Thursday
when everyone thinks

91
00:03:59,827 --> 00:04:01,528
he's out jogging
in Rock Creek Park,

92
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:04,532
he's in fact, visiting this
bathhouse off Dupont Circle.

93
00:04:06,969 --> 00:04:11,073
We managed to get inside during
his most recent visit.

94
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:23,986
As you can see,
he's a naughty boy.

95
00:04:27,724 --> 00:04:30,625
I believe that item one and item
two will get us what we want,

96
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,561
which is for this son of a bitch
to tell where Tom Walker is

97
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:35,396
and what he and Abu Nazir
are plotting.

98
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,364
<i>Most of Al Zahrani's debt</i>
<i>is carried</i>

99
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,966
<i>by a private equity bank</i>
<i>called Market Security.</i>

100
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,001
<i>As I said, we don't have much,</i>

101
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,336
<i>but we definitely</i>
<i>have something.</i>

102
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,006
(jazz playing)

103
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:01,252
William Pritchard?
That's me.

104
00:05:01,287 --> 00:05:03,989
Ah.

105
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,757
I'm Carrie Mathison.

106
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,993
You're really a spy?

107
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:10,028
Uh, an intelligence
officer actually.

108
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:11,330
This is very cool.

109
00:05:11,364 --> 00:05:12,898
Can I tell my wife about this?

110
00:05:12,932 --> 00:05:16,335
No.
Even cooler.

111
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:18,404
As I mentioned on the phone,
we're interested in

112
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:20,773
one of your clients--
Mansoor Al Zahrani.

113
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,875
Yeah, I pulled his file.
Makes dismal reading.

114
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:26,078
How'd you like
to cause him some pain?

115
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:27,779
I'd rather have the
money he owes us,

116
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:30,215
but short of that, pain
might be satisfying.

117
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:31,516
What can I do?

118
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:34,352
We'd like to borrow your bank.

119
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,287
You sure I can't tell my wife?

120
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:07,650
(vehicle doors closing)

121
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:32,039
(knocking on door)

122
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:40,314
(knocking)

123
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:50,793
Sergeant Brody?
Yes.

124
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,263
We need to check
your house, sir.

125
00:06:54,297 --> 00:06:56,765
What the fuck?
We're Secret Service, sir.

126
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,975
(door opening)

127
00:07:08,377 --> 00:07:12,113
Sergeant Brody,
sorry for the intrusion.

128
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:14,014
Everyone's a little on edge

129
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:16,317
because of your
sniper buddy I'm afraid.

130
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:21,457
I have to ask-- is Walker as
good a shot as they say he is?

131
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,859
Yes, he is.

132
00:07:23,894 --> 00:07:25,528
Too bad for us.

133
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,029
(chuckles)

134
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,231
Clear the room.

135
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,970
I'm very impressed
with the way you've handled

136
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:35,872
coming back to the real world.

137
00:07:35,907 --> 00:07:37,840
Thank you, sir.

138
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,542
Representative Richard Johnson--
mean anything to you?

139
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:43,045
I watch the news.

140
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,147
How would you feel about
running for his seat

141
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,148
in the upcoming
special election?

142
00:07:47,182 --> 00:07:51,418
I would consider it a honor
to work with a man

143
00:07:51,453 --> 00:07:53,987
who's actually fought
the war on terror.

144
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,688
Who's lived among the enemy,

145
00:07:55,723 --> 00:07:57,223
and understands them.

146
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:01,861
What do you think?

147
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,962
You interested?

148
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:08,934
Yeah.

149
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,336
I'm interested.

150
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,871
Good news, good news.

151
00:08:14,974 --> 00:08:18,543
I'd need to talk
to my wife first.

152
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:19,544
Is that a problem?

153
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:21,212
To be honest, it could be.

154
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:24,748
Well, we need her on board.
She's half the story.

155
00:08:24,782 --> 00:08:27,717
War hero returns home
after eight years' imprisonment

156
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:29,786
to his beautiful, loving wife.

157
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,589
I'm sure you'll be able
to convince her.

158
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,059
(clicks tongue)

159
00:08:38,295 --> 00:08:39,796
AGENT:
On the move.

160
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,535
(door closes)

161
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,542
Al Zahrani's got
diplomatic immunity.

162
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:53,579
That may not mean
much to you people,

163
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:56,982
but to us mere mortals in the State
Department, that's a serious issue.

164
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,483
We're not dragging him
to Tunisia.

165
00:08:58,517 --> 00:08:59,784
We're not waterboarding.

166
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,153
We'll be very
polite and gentle.

167
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:04,289
I just want to ask him some
questions during his lunch hour.

168
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:07,258
The CIA's not even supposed to
be operating on American soil.

169
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:10,294
It's against your own charter.
This is the FBI's job.

170
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:13,931
SAUL: Al Zahrani's running a terrorist
cell out of the Saudi embassy.

171
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:16,733
He and Tom Walker are planning
an attack on the United States.

172
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:18,135
Fuck the charter.

173
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:20,571
He doesn't mean that.
Yes, I do.

174
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:23,341
You don't know if
this thing will work.

175
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:24,843
You grab the guy...

176
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:26,445
Entice.
You entice the guy

177
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,113
into the bank, and then what?

178
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:29,415
You got a couple
of hours maybe.

179
00:09:29,449 --> 00:09:31,083
We figure two at the outside.

180
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:32,451
You have two measly hours

181
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:34,654
before the Saudi embassy
starts missing him.

182
00:09:34,688 --> 00:09:36,689
What if he doesn't turn?

183
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,091
Being gay in Saudi Arabia is
like being the Antichrist here.

184
00:09:39,126 --> 00:09:42,128
I'm aware of our cultural
differences with Saudi Arabia.

185
00:09:42,162 --> 00:09:44,664
If Al Zahrani doesn't turn
and we blow the whistle on him,

186
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,833
he can look forward
to losing everything.

187
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:49,770
I mean everything.
I see no compelling reason not to do this.

188
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:53,306
Were you not listening?
I just gave you ten of them.

189
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:56,109
I'm going to the secretary
on this one, David.

190
00:09:56,143 --> 00:10:00,447
And I will be appending all of my
objections right on the fucking order.

191
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:02,283
Append away.

192
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,723
Carrie, I want you to run
the interrogation.

193
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:10,693
Shouldn't it be Saul?

194
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:13,062
Al Zahrani will be thrown
if it's a woman.

195
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:15,665
Might give us some leverage.
David's right.

196
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,506
Everything we know
about Al Zahrani's in here.

197
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,841
Are you sure you're okay
with my doing this?

198
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,311
You're the right person
for the job.

199
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:31,213
Saul?

200
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:34,850
I'm fine.

201
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:41,590
Remember what you said to me way back about
getting the truth out of these guys?

202
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:43,258
What?

203
00:10:43,292 --> 00:10:45,260
You're trying to find
what makes them human,

204
00:10:45,294 --> 00:10:48,196
not what makes them terrorists.

205
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,233
Sounds like good advice.

206
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,770
Better get started.

207
00:11:20,396 --> 00:11:23,765
Oh, Jesus. You scared me. Sorry.

208
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,633
Kids get to school okay?

209
00:11:25,668 --> 00:11:27,635
Yeah, with the usual hysterics.

210
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,139
Chris is convinced he's the worst
athlete in the entire eighth grade,

211
00:11:31,173 --> 00:11:33,140
and Dana's convinced
she's a lesbian,

212
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,476
'cause boys disgust her.

213
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,716
What's going on?

214
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,820
While you were gone,
I had a visitor.

215
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:46,589
Who?

216
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:50,260
Vice President
of the United States.

217
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:52,929
In our house?
It's a mess.

218
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,631
I doubt he noticed.

219
00:11:54,665 --> 00:11:56,633
What did he want?

220
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,802
You remember
Congressman Johnson?

221
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:01,905
That poor bastard we saw
on the TV at Gaines' house?

222
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:05,275
He's resigning, and they
want me to run for his seat.

223
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:07,276
I knew it.

224
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:08,845
You said no, right?

225
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,846
Well, I said I'd talk
it over with you first.

226
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:12,181
You're actually considering it?

227
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,449
You can't be serious.

228
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,317
Well, what else am I gonna do?

229
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:17,653
Hell, stay in the Corps and
go back to Iraq? Brody,

230
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:19,455
we're just getting our
lives back on track.

231
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,324
We're just getting our
<i>marriage</i> back on track.

232
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,960
And you want to go into politics?
We'll never see you.

233
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:26,030
It'll be like you're
leaving us all over again.

234
00:12:26,064 --> 00:12:27,698
I'll carve out plenty of time
for you and the kids.

235
00:12:27,732 --> 00:12:29,433
No. Absolutely not.

236
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:30,701
You cannot do this.

237
00:12:32,204 --> 00:12:34,005
I think I can make a difference.

238
00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:36,608
Do you want our family to
be dragged through the mud

239
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:39,844
by every newspaper and cable
news channel in the country?

240
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,479
Because that's what's gonna
happen-- they're gonna dig

241
00:12:41,514 --> 00:12:43,548
for dirt until they found it.
You don't know that.

242
00:12:43,582 --> 00:12:44,816
Me and Mike.

243
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,151
You and that CIA lady
you fucked.

244
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:56,226
Don't be naive.

245
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,164
It'll all come out,
every last gory detail.

246
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:05,370
I got to go change.
I seem to have become

247
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:08,540
one of those women who takes her
kids to school in her pajamas.

248
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:17,918
VIRGIL:
Wives.

249
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:21,554
Three-- Zahra, Hala and Yasmeen.

250
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:23,657
He met Zahra when
they were both 15.

251
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:25,358
An arranged marriage,
of course.

252
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:28,862
He had his first
five children with her.

253
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:31,666
(groans) Um...

254
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,035
Farid, Suhail...

255
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:35,770
Gamila,

256
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:36,938
Huda and Wadiya.

257
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:38,205
How can someone

258
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,440
be 15 and married?

259
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:41,042
What could a
15-year-old

260
00:13:41,076 --> 00:13:43,544
possibly know about the
intricacies of a relationship,

261
00:13:43,579 --> 00:13:45,512
about taking care of a family?

262
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:47,014
More than you do?

263
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:48,082
Oh...

264
00:13:48,116 --> 00:13:50,918
(phone ringing) (sighs)

265
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:56,056
Mathison.

266
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,725
Hey, it's me, Brody.

267
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,694
You there?

268
00:14:01,728 --> 00:14:03,095
Yeah, I'm here.

269
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:04,663
I need to see you.

270
00:14:06,098 --> 00:14:08,099
Why?

271
00:14:08,134 --> 00:14:10,367
It's personal.

272
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:12,603
Well, when?

273
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:13,838
Now.

274
00:14:15,473 --> 00:14:19,143
I-I can't.
How about tomorrow night?

275
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:21,946
What's wrong with tonight?
I'm working.

276
00:14:21,981 --> 00:14:24,082
Yeah, she's working.

277
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,450
Who's that?

278
00:14:25,485 --> 00:14:29,288
Uh, nobody.
It's a... a neighbor.

279
00:14:29,322 --> 00:14:32,158
You sure you can't
make it tonight?

280
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:35,562
Yeah, I'm sure. Sorry.

281
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,332
Okay, tomorrow.
When and where?

282
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:41,168
We could go to that bar.

283
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:43,771
Why don't I just come
to your place?

284
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:48,142
Oh... Okay. Sure.

285
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:51,612
7:00?
I'll text you the address.

286
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,315
Okay, great.
See you then.

287
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:58,486
Hot date?

288
00:14:59,789 --> 00:15:02,324
Hardly.

289
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:04,159
So you're texting
your address to a plumber?

290
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,128
It's none
of your fucking business

291
00:15:06,163 --> 00:15:09,331
who I'm texting my address to.

292
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,434
So you think we have enough?

293
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:14,103
You think Al Zahrani will turn?

294
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:16,105
(sighs)
Well, you know as well as I do,

295
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,875
there's guys who roll over
and beg and mercy,

296
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:21,878
and then there's those other
guys who get all heroic,

297
00:15:21,912 --> 00:15:23,580
and are willing to die
for the cause.

298
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,499
(sighs)

299
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:51,675
He's here.

300
00:15:56,947 --> 00:15:58,848
Are you good?

301
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:01,818
Eye contact, please.

302
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm good.

303
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:07,323
Good. It's good
that you're good.

304
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:10,059
Good is a good thing.

305
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,163
Carrie.

306
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,969
Eviscerate the motherfucker.

307
00:16:45,731 --> 00:16:47,967
Hey.
Hey.

308
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,436
They told me I might
find you in here.

309
00:16:50,471 --> 00:16:52,806
Working on your jump shot?

310
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,975
Something like that.

311
00:16:56,845 --> 00:17:00,213
How's the jaw?
Fine.

312
00:17:00,248 --> 00:17:04,184
I'm sorry, dude.
I was way out of line.

313
00:17:05,853 --> 00:17:09,723
No. I deserved it.

314
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:16,896
What do you want, Brody?

315
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:23,602
I'm telling you, man, this whole
coming home thing is tough.

316
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:25,971
I hear you. I'm either parading
around like a toy soldier

317
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,873
or doing the fucking laundry.

318
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,908
I need to be of service.

319
00:17:30,943 --> 00:17:32,643
I need to do something
that matters.

320
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,948
I've been asked by Vice President
Walden to run for congress.

321
00:17:37,983 --> 00:17:42,019
You fucking serious?
Yeah.

322
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:44,422
Jess doesn't want me to do it.

323
00:17:44,456 --> 00:17:48,292
She's exercising her veto rights.
Why?

324
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:51,196
I think she's afraid
of being in the limelight.

325
00:17:58,671 --> 00:17:59,938
You want to do it?

326
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:03,042
I got to do something.

327
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:09,148
Either that or I keep being
pulled back into fucking Iraq.

328
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:12,651
It's messing with my family.

329
00:18:12,686 --> 00:18:15,955
I get these moods.

330
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:18,557
I'm no fun to be around.

331
00:18:23,229 --> 00:18:25,731
Hey, Mikey, you and, uh...

332
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:29,735
you and Jessica...

333
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:35,841
you didn't do anything wrong.

334
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:43,448
And I can't blame you
for whatever happened.

335
00:18:45,785 --> 00:18:48,220
You thought I was dead.

336
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:51,122
And I know you guys got close.

337
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:58,763
And I'm sure it's not easy for you
to say good-bye to each other.

338
00:19:01,032 --> 00:19:04,000
And, um, this whole situation

339
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:05,935
is entirely fucked up.

340
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:15,410
Talk to Jessica.

341
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:18,547
Tell her how much
this means to me.

342
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:21,016
I got to get
my family back together.

343
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:30,293
And, um... she'll listen to you.

344
00:19:40,672 --> 00:19:43,773
Thanks.

345
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:55,417
Hey, something else.

346
00:19:57,754 --> 00:20:00,822
You took care of my kids.

347
00:20:00,856 --> 00:20:04,060
I'll always be grateful.

348
00:20:26,384 --> 00:20:28,485
PRITCHARD: Right this way.
We'll get it all sorted out.

349
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,087
Mansoor Al Zahrani, I'd
like to introduce you

350
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:32,855
to Eli Soodik and
Carol Sweetzer,

351
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:34,690
my top loan officers.

352
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:37,359
They'll lay out the details
of your debt restructuring.

353
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:38,627
I'll leave you to it.

354
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:40,028
I'm around if you need me.

355
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,666
CARRIE:
Security.

356
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:46,435
It's an unfortunate necessity
these days.

357
00:20:46,469 --> 00:20:48,837
Security for what?

358
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:50,605
It's not like you're going
to hand me cash after all.

359
00:20:50,639 --> 00:20:52,307
Please sit down.
Let's begin.

360
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:53,708
We have some questions
we'd like to ask you.

361
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:56,011
We don't have much time.

362
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:59,214
We need to get you back to your
embassy by the end of lunch hour.

363
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:01,883
You're not loan officers.
Who are you?

364
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:07,489
I would like to leave now.
I'm afraid we can't allow that.

365
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:10,693
You're CIA?

366
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,494
FBI?

367
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:14,129
Whoever you are,
you can't hold me.

368
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:15,964
I'm a Saudi diplomat.

369
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:19,368
I have diplomatic protection.
You know what,

370
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:21,170
I'm going to call my embassy
right now.

371
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,374
This is outrageous.
I will not allow it.

372
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,744
My ambassador will go
straight to the White House

373
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:29,912
and you will both
lose your jobs.

374
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:32,348
Why don't you take a look
at these photographs.

375
00:21:32,382 --> 00:21:34,951
Then you can call
anyone you want.

376
00:22:00,978 --> 00:22:03,079
Here.

377
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,219
I will not betray my country.

378
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:12,121
Of course not.

379
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:14,090
Sit down please.

380
00:22:26,237 --> 00:22:30,040
You owe Market Security
$750,000.

381
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:32,976
Your salary at the Saudi embassy

382
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,045
is $170,000 a year.

383
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,314
You've sold all of your stocks
in the past three years.

384
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:38,782
You have no savings.

385
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:41,551
You have no other
real estate holdings.

386
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,220
Is that a fair summation?

387
00:22:43,254 --> 00:22:45,722
Your point?

388
00:22:45,757 --> 00:22:49,159
You're spending more than you make.
(chuckles)

389
00:22:49,193 --> 00:22:51,128
Substantially.
Is that a crime?

390
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:53,164
No, not in and of itself,

391
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:54,898
but it is curious to note

392
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:58,803
that you are somehow meeting all
of your financial obligations.

393
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,444
What's in Geneva?

394
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:10,083
Cuckoo clocks.
Why have you traveled there

395
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:12,752
six times in the past year?

396
00:23:12,787 --> 00:23:16,022
Business for my government.

397
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,457
Well, our friends
in Switzerland

398
00:23:17,491 --> 00:23:20,293
inform us that on the morning
of last Saturday,

399
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:22,595
you had breakfast
at the Beau-Rivage Hotel

400
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,864
with a man named Faraz Sabbaq.

401
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:28,300
He handed you an envelope.

402
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:30,302
You then carried this envelope

403
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:33,271
to the Clariden Leu Bank
on Rue Francois-Versonnex.

404
00:23:33,305 --> 00:23:35,874
20 minutes later you exited
the Clariden Leu Bank

405
00:23:35,908 --> 00:23:37,676
without the envelope.

406
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:40,445
You should know that Swiss officials
had their eyes on Sabbaq,

407
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,715
and then you of course,

408
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:45,285
because he is a trusted
courier for Abu Nazir.

409
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,056
I don't know Abu Nazir.

410
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:52,694
Abu Nazir gives money to Sabbaq,
Sabbaq hands money to you,

411
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:54,796
you deposit the money
in a Swiss bank

412
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,299
and use it to pay your bills.

413
00:23:58,334 --> 00:24:01,335
Why lose everything for a cause
you don't even believe in?

414
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,370
You're obviously not a zealot.

415
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:07,040
You don't believe in radical
Islam. You love the West.

416
00:24:07,074 --> 00:24:09,909
No more questions.

417
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:11,210
I am done talking
to both of you.

418
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:12,912
Do you really want me to share

419
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:14,513
these photos with your wives,

420
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:16,482
your children, your parents,

421
00:24:16,516 --> 00:24:18,551
your ambassador?

422
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:30,163
Go ahead.

423
00:24:30,198 --> 00:24:32,833
Tell everyone you want.
Tell them all, I don't care.

424
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:36,170
I suck cock and I love it.

425
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:38,005
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

426
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,341
My wives already know.

427
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,542
They don't care.

428
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:43,944
They love me.
So fuck it, huh?

429
00:24:43,978 --> 00:24:45,611
And fuck you.

430
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:47,713
Put me on CNN.

431
00:24:47,748 --> 00:24:49,415
I'll admit to everything.

432
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,420
Now I would like to go
back to my embassy.

433
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:01,626
Sit the fuck down!
I'm not finished!

434
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,262
Oh, I think you are. Mr.
Al Zahrani, I'd like to remind you...

435
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:07,331
You love your children
very much, don't you?

436
00:25:20,414 --> 00:25:22,248
Do you have a favorite?

437
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:24,484
No, of course not.

438
00:25:25,686 --> 00:25:27,721
I think Janine

439
00:25:27,755 --> 00:25:29,490
is your favorite.

440
00:25:29,524 --> 00:25:32,627
She is a very remarkable
young woman,

441
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,296
but all of my children
are remarkable.

442
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,498
Not one of your other children
is a sophomore at Yale

443
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:40,135
majoring in
political philosophy.

444
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:43,238
Not one of your other children
was a National Merit Scholar.

445
00:25:43,272 --> 00:25:47,075
Not one of your other children
has spent two full days with you

446
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:51,313
at the Phillips Gallery, happily looking
at your beloved Impressionists.

447
00:25:51,347 --> 00:25:53,348
We would deport her.

448
00:25:53,382 --> 00:25:57,786
And we would make sure that she
was not welcome in England,

449
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,287
or Germany, or France,

450
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:02,757
or Italy, or even
all-forgiving Scandinavia.

451
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:05,126
We would make sure that
she had no choice

452
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,695
but to go back to Saudi Arabia
and get fat

453
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,067
and wear a burkha for the
rest of her miserable life.

454
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:38,659
What do you do for Abu Nazir

455
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,896
in return for the money
he gives you?

456
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,664
What do you do for Abu Nazir

457
00:26:43,698 --> 00:26:47,800
in return for
the money he give you?

458
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:50,470
I keep my ears open.

459
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:52,905
Tell him what the Saudi
government is thinking.

460
00:26:52,939 --> 00:26:54,540
General information.

461
00:26:54,574 --> 00:26:57,175
You met with Tom Walker
at least three times

462
00:26:57,209 --> 00:26:59,844
at the Mount Olivet Mosque
last week, correct?

463
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:03,181
Yes.

464
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:06,318
Tom Walker is working
for Abu Nazir?

465
00:27:06,352 --> 00:27:07,886
Yes.

466
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,888
Was he meant to shoot
the president

467
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,090
from the roof of a house
near Ronald Reagan Airport?

468
00:27:12,124 --> 00:27:15,994
I don't know
anything about that.

469
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:17,429
Where is Tom Walker now?

470
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:20,099
He's lying low.
Where?

471
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:21,834
I don't know.

472
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:23,870
What's his current assignment?
I don't know.

473
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:25,238
When will you know?

474
00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:27,073
When Abu Nazir decides
to tell me.

475
00:27:27,108 --> 00:27:31,712
What the tradecraft for setting
a meeting with Walker?

476
00:27:38,053 --> 00:27:40,721
(sighs)

477
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:45,058
I put my child's drawing
of a red heart

478
00:27:45,093 --> 00:27:47,527
in the window of my living room.

479
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:51,031
When would the
meeting take place?

480
00:27:51,065 --> 00:27:53,567
The next day at noon.

481
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:55,102
Where?

482
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,443
Farragut Square
by the fountain.

483
00:28:02,477 --> 00:28:04,779
SAUL:
Mr. Al Zahrani,

484
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:06,614
I'd like you to go back
to your house now,

485
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:08,048
put that drawing in your window
tonight.

486
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:10,484
Tomorrow afternoon,
I'd like you to proceed

487
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,753
as you normally would
to meet Tom Walker.

488
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:14,455
Okay?

489
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:17,491
So I'm bait?
You're bait.

490
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:20,494
You're free to go now.

491
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:27,568
What happens to me
after all of this?

492
00:28:27,603 --> 00:28:29,337
Go about your business,
live your life.

493
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:31,506
We say nothing
to Saudi intelligence

494
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,308
about your connections
to Abu Nazir,

495
00:28:33,342 --> 00:28:35,810
you say nothing to Abu Nazir
about our little get-together.

496
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:38,179
You work for us now.

497
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:40,681
Welcome to the CIA.

498
00:28:46,322 --> 00:28:50,125
Oh, damn it! Ow.

499
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,595
(doorbell ringing)

500
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,507
Mike.
Hello.

501
00:29:05,541 --> 00:29:08,376
Hi. Come in.

502
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,612
No, it's better if
I stay out here.

503
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:13,146
Oh, okay.

504
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:16,883
How have you been?

505
00:29:16,918 --> 00:29:18,652
Shitty.

506
00:29:18,686 --> 00:29:21,855
Brody came to see me.

507
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,958
He did?

508
00:29:23,992 --> 00:29:27,060
Apologized for slugging me.

509
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,232
He said he doesn't blame
either one of us for anything.

510
00:29:32,266 --> 00:29:33,700
I mean, Christ,
he even thanked me

511
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,869
for taking care of the kids.

512
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:37,970
God.
I know.

513
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:40,706
He's trying, Jess,
he's really trying.

514
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,043
He told me about being
asked to run for congress.

515
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,212
Told me you were against it.

516
00:29:49,048 --> 00:29:52,016
I'm just thinking
of the family.

517
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,884
What's best for the family.

518
00:29:56,221 --> 00:29:59,925
Jess, right now, Brody's
a marine without a mission.

519
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:02,327
He's a lost man wandering
around in the fog.

520
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:04,697
This thing, really means
a lot to him.

521
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:05,932
He wants to be of service.

522
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:07,600
He wants to do this.

523
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:09,703
Let him.

524
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:11,838
He'll be a better father,

525
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:13,507
a better husband.

526
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:20,447
He put you up to this.

527
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:25,685
Yeah, he did.
So what?

528
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:27,954
He's right.

529
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,958
That's unbelievable.

530
00:30:32,992 --> 00:30:36,461
He comes to you and now
here you are, on his behalf?

531
00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:37,862
It's a little incestuous,
isn't it?

532
00:30:37,896 --> 00:30:39,797
Why don't we all just
take off our clothes

533
00:30:39,832 --> 00:30:42,100
and get in bed together?
Jess, come on.

534
00:30:42,134 --> 00:30:43,602
I got to go.

535
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:46,405
(door opens)

536
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:13,532
(mellow jazz playing)

537
00:31:23,943 --> 00:31:27,012
(doorbell ringing)

538
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,957
Hi there.

539
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:39,158
Hi.

540
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:41,360
Come on in.

541
00:31:57,345 --> 00:31:59,380
Miles Davis.

542
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,281
Do you like jazz?

543
00:32:01,316 --> 00:32:03,251
I don't know anything about it.

544
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,627
Here we go.

545
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:13,828
Oh, no thanks.

546
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:20,568
I really just came around
to ask you something.

547
00:32:20,603 --> 00:32:23,838
I need you to be honest.
What?

548
00:32:23,872 --> 00:32:26,573
Does anybody at the CIA know about
our weekend up at the cabin?

549
00:32:26,608 --> 00:32:28,475
No.

550
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:31,244
You didn't tell anybody?
No.

551
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,514
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

552
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:36,716
Is there any way
they could find out?

553
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,885
Not unless I did tell them.

554
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,387
Which you wouldn't do.

555
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:44,024
Believe it or not,
I value my privacy.

556
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,560
Why the concern?

557
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:48,429
I've been asked to run
for political office.

558
00:32:48,464 --> 00:32:53,034
Political office?
What are you talking about?

559
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:58,174
Vice President Walden wants me to
run for Congressman Johnson's seat.

560
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:01,911
Really? Wow.

561
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:04,379
Well, that's....

562
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:07,082
That's surprising.

563
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:08,517
I don't want to do it
if there's even a chance

564
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:10,919
the media would
find out about us.

565
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:13,022
I can't do that to Jessica.

566
00:33:13,056 --> 00:33:15,891
I've been shitty
enough as it is,

567
00:33:15,925 --> 00:33:17,459
and she deserves better.

568
00:33:17,493 --> 00:33:19,861
And she's going to get it.

569
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,202
Jessica will never know.

570
00:33:28,237 --> 00:33:30,772
Thanks.

571
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:36,945
I should get back home.

572
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,781
Yeah, I'm beat.

573
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:41,651
It's been a rough day.

574
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,199
You promise me this will
stay between us?

575
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:59,436
I promise.

576
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,071
Good-bye.

577
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,340

Excuse me.

587

Saul, any sign of Walker?

588
00:37:13,395 --> 00:37:14,762
Nothing yet.

589
00:37:14,796 --> 00:37:17,531
We got 15 of our people
in the square.

590
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:19,834
And Carrie's running point
down there.

591
00:37:49,532 --> 00:37:53,368
Remember, everybody,
Walker is armed and dangerous.

592
00:37:53,402 --> 00:37:54,869
We don't want a firefight.

593

We're here to nab him,
not spook him.

Walker's in the grab zone.

Carrie?

596

I know the protocol, Saul.

Possible Walker.

He's... got a green watch cap.

622
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,512
Black fleece.
He's carrying a briefcase.

in case this whole thing
goes to shit.

Looks like he's headed
to the fountain all right.

628
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:38,172
Nobody makes a move
until Walker's in the grab zone.

CARRIE:
I can't see his face.

I need visual confirmation.

Finklestein, you're up front.

Go for a clear view.
FINKLESTEIN: Roger that.

633
00:40:50,185 --> 00:40:52,053
CARRIE: Franklin, Patrelli,
approach him from the east.

FRANKLIN: 10-4.
PATRELLI: On it.

He's approaching Al Zahrani.

636
00:40:56,358 --> 00:40:57,758
I want that positive ID now.

637
00:40:57,792 --> 00:40:59,193
CARRIE:
Shit. Finklestein?

638
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:01,095
FINKLESTEIN:
I'm trying.

639
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:03,330
Franklin? Patrelli?

640
00:41:03,365 --> 00:41:04,765
FRANKLIN:
It could be Walker.

641
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,234
It's hard to tell.
His head's down.

642
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:07,602
Patrelli?

643
00:41:07,636 --> 00:41:09,271
PATRELLI:
Black male, six feet,

644
00:41:09,305 --> 00:41:11,173
clean-shaven, athletic.

645
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,109
I can't tell.

646
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:17,047
He's carrying the briefcase
in his left hand.

647
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:19,049
So?
Walker's right-handed.

648
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,017
What about his watch?
Can anybody see his watch?

649
00:41:22,152 --> 00:41:24,386
SAUL:
It's on his right wrist.

650
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:25,788
I don't like this, Saul.

651
00:41:25,822 --> 00:41:27,757
Should I engage?
SAUL: Negative.

652
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,125
CARRIE: What's in the briefcase?

653
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,560
Saul, what's in
the fucking briefcase?

654
00:41:33,496 --> 00:41:35,097
SAUL:
Wait for my command.

655
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:36,865
WHIT: Copy that. Shit.

656
00:41:36,899 --> 00:41:38,367
Sorry. Pull back.

657
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:39,769
Pull back.
Get everyone out of here.

658
00:41:46,176 --> 00:41:48,411
(buttons beeping)

659
00:41:51,115 --> 00:41:52,649
CARRIE:
Everyone, get out of here!

660
00:41:57,088 --> 00:41:59,690
(car alarms blaring)

661
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,161
(phones ringing)

662
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:07,830
(car alarms blaring)

663
00:42:07,865 --> 00:42:09,331
Carrie!

664
00:42:10,367 --> 00:42:12,134
Carrie.

665
00:42:13,336 --> 00:42:14,737
Carrie?

666
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:16,772
(high-pitched ringing)

667
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,315
(no audio)

668
00:42:44,138 --> 00:42:46,138
(ringing continues)

669
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:50,977
The explosion occurred
during the busy lunch hour

670
00:42:51,011 --> 00:42:53,112
and killed five people,
wounded dozens,

671
00:42:53,147 --> 00:42:55,648
and shut down the city Metro line.
(door opens and closes)

672
00:42:55,682 --> 00:42:57,684
FBI special agents have joined

673
00:42:57,718 --> 00:42:59,652
D.C. police in cordoning off
the area.

674
00:42:59,687 --> 00:43:01,054
It was a suicide bomber--

675
00:43:01,088 --> 00:43:02,822
a terrorist attack
right here in D.C.

676
00:43:02,857 --> 00:43:04,557
We don't know that.

677
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:06,993
It's just unbelievable.
Hey.

678
00:43:07,027 --> 00:43:08,394
Hey. Listen.

679
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:09,796
It's probably just
some crazy guy

680
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,831
who learned how to make a bomb
on the Internet.

681
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:13,533
Okay?

682
00:43:13,567 --> 00:43:16,636
The most important thing
is not to panic.

683
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:18,872
Okay.

684
00:43:18,906 --> 00:43:20,340
Where are the kids?

685
00:43:20,374 --> 00:43:21,808
They're doing their homework.

686
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:23,043
Are they okay?

687
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:24,344
They're scared.

688
00:43:24,379 --> 00:43:26,614
All right.
I'll go and talk to them.

689
00:43:29,718 --> 00:43:31,986
Hey. Did you
think any more

690
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,789
about the, uh,
politics of it all?

691
00:43:41,096 --> 00:43:42,797
Mike delivered your message.

692
00:43:45,033 --> 00:43:46,834
And?

693
00:43:46,868 --> 00:43:48,335
I told the kids

694
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,104
about the vice president
wanting you to run.

695
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:51,538
You told them?

696
00:43:51,573 --> 00:43:53,540
We discussed how it
would affect our future,

697
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:56,042
that there would be
publicity and scrutiny

698
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:59,446
and gossip... (sighs)

699
00:43:59,481 --> 00:44:03,451
but in the end, we all agreed
that we wanted you to do it.

700
00:44:06,288 --> 00:44:09,457
Just to be clear,
are you saying yes?

701
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,062
Just promise me
I won't lose you again.

702
00:44:14,096 --> 00:44:16,798
I promise.

703
00:44:16,832 --> 00:44:18,800
Then yes.

704
00:44:18,834 --> 00:44:20,535
It's a yes.

705
00:44:25,574 --> 00:44:28,009
(rhythmic beeping)

706
00:44:53,369 --> 00:44:55,838
(applause)

707
00:44:55,872 --> 00:44:58,207
Thanks for coming out, folks.

708
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:08,751
(camera shutters clicking)

709
00:45:16,226 --> 00:45:19,195
Dr. Steiner says
you're going to live.

710
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:21,630
All you got was a
really bad concussion.

711
00:45:21,665 --> 00:45:24,033
No more head bashing
for a while.

712
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:26,268
Cut back on the drinking.

713
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:28,669
Otherwise, you're good to go.

714
00:45:33,676 --> 00:45:36,544
Get some really good
drugs and a week's rest

715
00:45:36,578 --> 00:45:39,180
before you head back
to the glue factory.

716
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:42,350
I'd love some good drugs
and a week's rest.

717
00:45:42,385 --> 00:45:44,953
Lucky you.

718
00:45:44,987 --> 00:45:47,622
In case you're wondering
about the bomber--

719
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:49,825
black guy with
the briefcase--

720
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:51,960
his name was Samuel Everett.

721
00:45:51,995 --> 00:45:53,195
Homeless guy.

722
00:45:53,229 --> 00:45:54,864
Walker met him at the shelter.

723
00:45:54,898 --> 00:45:57,867
Must have paid him to
go meet Al Zahrani.

724
00:46:01,505 --> 00:46:03,874
How did Walker know?

725
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:06,176
Who warned him?

726
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:08,645
Same person who slipped
Hamid a razor blade

727
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:10,647
so that he could
slash his wrists.

728
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:13,483
And the same person who warned
Raqim Faisel and Aileen Morgan

729
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:16,319
that we were onto their
safe house near the airport.

730
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:22,057
You were right.

731
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:24,527
Abu Nazir has someone
inside the U.S. government.

732
00:46:24,561 --> 00:46:26,862
REPORTER (on TV): We take you
now live to the Capitol steps

733
00:46:26,897 --> 00:46:31,000
where the vice president is set
to make his announcement.

734
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:34,169
Sergeant Brody is exactly
the kind of congressman we need.

735
00:46:34,204 --> 00:46:35,437
His strength of character
is beyond question...

736
00:46:35,472 --> 00:46:37,072
Turn it up.

737
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:38,406
And he is resolute
in the fight against terrorism,

738
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:39,841
which struck at the heart

739
00:46:39,876 --> 00:46:42,010
of this nation's capitol
just yesterday.

740
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:44,046
He will be equally resolute
in the fight

741
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,680
against runaway spending
and profligate management

742
00:46:45,715 --> 00:46:47,682
at the highest levels
of government.

743
00:46:47,716 --> 00:46:49,684
(applause)

744
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:52,020
BRODY: It gives me great
pleasure and pride

745
00:46:52,054 --> 00:46:54,222
to stand here today before you

746
00:46:54,256 --> 00:46:57,793
having been given the generous
opportunity to serve.

747
00:46:57,827 --> 00:46:59,961
You know, what I really came
to understand

748
00:46:59,996 --> 00:47:01,396
lying in a dark hole

749
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:02,964
for eight years
in the Middle East

750
00:47:02,998 --> 00:47:04,966
was that service
for your country

751
00:47:05,001 --> 00:47:07,702
is the highest calling.

752
00:47:07,736 --> 00:47:10,404
Sacred and profound.

753
00:47:10,438 --> 00:47:12,139
(applause, cheering)

754
00:47:25,453 --> 00:47:27,154
(turns TV off)

755
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:44,305
