00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:02,837
Previously on<i> House of Cards</i>...

2
00:00:02,862 --> 00:00:05,520
We get killed in the midterms,
we can kiss 2016 goodbye.

3
00:00:05,545 --> 00:00:08,095
You can deal with the Republican
majority and a Republican president.

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,448
Tusk.

5
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:11,922
Are you funneling money
to the Republicans?

6
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:13,451
What on earth
are you talking about?

7
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:16,826
I need the money to stop
flowing in the wrong direction.

8
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:20,025
You're sending money to Lanagin.
Lanagin's casino is in Tusk's backyard.

9
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:22,005
We can't offer you a gift if
I don't know what you want.

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,915
The Port Jefferson Bridge.
I have allies who want the bridge.

11
00:00:25,328 --> 00:00:26,889
Without it, they become my enemies.

12
00:00:26,914 --> 00:00:29,074
Get out. Please.

13
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:34,202
Rachel...
You should answer when I call.

14
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:35,756
I don't like leaving messages.

15
00:00:36,056 --> 00:00:37,703
If you need a punching bag,

16
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:42,314
I will stand here and take the punches,
as I have done time and time again.

17
00:00:42,339 --> 00:00:44,009
You are out of line, Frank.

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,605
- What should we serve the Walkers?
- Cyanide.

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,035
- Saving that for dessert.
- Oh, no. None, none for me, thanks.

20
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,136
I'll have some.

21
00:00:51,378 --> 00:00:53,962
Trish, if it's eating at you,
make him talk about it.

22
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,936
The White House is finite.
Your marriage... is for life.

Evelyn...

26
00:03:01,376 --> 00:03:03,975
- Mr. Danton.
- Remy.

27
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:07,614
- How are you?
- I'm OK. I'm good.

28
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:10,735
- Been awhile.
- Yeah, it has.

29
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:17,494
- Good morning.
- Mr. Vice President.

30
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:18,893
Chief Whitehall.

31
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:21,694
Is Andrew Jackson
going to be joining us?

32
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:25,773
No, I'm sorry, that's a terrible
oversight. Doug, will you... remove that.

33
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:28,015
Why don't we take
the photograph first.

34
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:35,254
Thank you.

35
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:36,776
Please have a seat.

36
00:03:40,854 --> 00:03:43,094
Let's talk federal recognition.

37
00:03:43,148 --> 00:03:45,428
Your tribe has waited
long enough.

38
00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,027
Who is it?

39
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:20,628
It's me.
It's Lisa.

40
00:04:27,107 --> 00:04:28,787
Can I come in?

41
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:32,267
Temp jobs, mostly.
Clerical work...

42
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:36,307
Right now I'm doing part-time
at a dentist's office. Reception.

43
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,027
You deserve better.

44
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,746
It is what it is.

45
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:43,547
This is the first time I've had
Starbucks since I can remember.

46
00:04:43,548 --> 00:04:46,146
It's a luxury for me these days.

47
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:49,026
Maybe there's something
for you at Glendon Hill.

48
00:04:49,027 --> 00:04:52,827
That's nice of you to say, but I'm not
the right fit for a place like that.

49
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:55,347
Sure you are. Twenty years' experience
in the non-profit sphere,

50
00:04:55,348 --> 00:04:58,548
you coordinated all the time
NGOs, you'd be a valuable asset to us.

51
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:03,867
- Claire should've never let you go.
- Yeah.

52
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:06,588
Well... I'll hold my tongue.

53
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:12,147
She and I don't talk.
We had a falling out.

54
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:14,587
- Loyalty isn't her thing.
- No, it is not.

55
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:16,906
I don't think
she's loyal to anyone.

56
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:23,427
- Except maybe her husband.
- Maybe... maybe not.

57
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:27,507
- What do you mean?
- Nothing I know for certain, but...

58
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:30,708
...spend a decade
working for someone...

59
00:05:35,988 --> 00:05:38,347
- She threaten you or anything?
- No.

60
00:05:38,348 --> 00:05:40,106
She just wouldn't leave.

61
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,667
It's not like I wanted to call
the cops, she's not a bad person.

62
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:45,587
- No, no, but...
- I tried to talk to her,

63
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:47,947
then she lit up a pipe.

64
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,747
- Meth.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:52,227
When we were roommates
that's all it was.

66
00:05:52,228 --> 00:05:54,588
I used to be really deep
into that.

67
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:57,907
Heroin too.

68
00:05:57,908 --> 00:06:01,226
- And then I found the Fellowship.
- What can I do?

69
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:04,267
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here...
- No, I'm glad you came here.

70
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:06,227
- I know you're late for work.
- I'll call in sick.

71
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:09,227
- Don't do that, it's not...
- Don't go, stay here.

72
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:11,388
I mean, don't go back there.

73
00:06:12,707 --> 00:06:14,587
Look...

74
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:19,226
- Are you sure?
- Keys. In case you need to come and go.

75
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:22,227
- I'll be back around 7:30.
- Thank you.

76
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,748
You don't have to thank me.

77
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:50,587
All the president has to do is pick up
the phone and the bridge is approved.

78
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,947
If the president had wanted to be involved,
he would've already made that call.

79
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:56,107
- It's his initiative, Linda. - Was his
initiative. We're in a trade war now.

80
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:57,986
That doesn't mean
we have to abandon good policy.

81
00:06:57,987 --> 00:06:59,667
It's inconsistent
with his current stance...

82
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,187
The committee on foreign
investment has 30 days to approve.

83
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,267
There's only six days left.
They won't act without

84
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:06,346
a directive from the president
of the United States.

85
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:10,306
I'm confused, you've been the biggest
proponent of our position against China.

86
00:07:10,307 --> 00:07:13,587
That is not true. I advocated
the opposite early on.

87
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:16,226
You seem fixated on this bridge.
Is something else going on here?

88
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,106
Unemployment is at
nine-point-two, inflation is skyrocketing,

89
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:20,947
we're on the verge
of losing our majority.

90
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,187
The president needs to offer
a piece of good news.

91
00:07:23,188 --> 00:07:25,307
A bridge? That's a drop
in the bucket.

92
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:27,746
Jobs, infrastructure,
deficit reduction...

93
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,947
You're still not
being straight with me.

94
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:31,987
I have no ulterior motive here,

95
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:35,507
but if you feel that strongly
and the president feels that strongly,

96
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:39,347
then I'll back off.
I won't mention it again.

97
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:42,587
I think that's a wise decision.
We should be a united front.

98
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,866
- I couldn't agree more.
- Thank you.

99
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:48,107
Why does everything
have to be a struggle?

100
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:51,667
- Can't some people just
say "yes" for once? - Sir.

101
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:53,987
I need the president's schedule
for the next two days.

102
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,907
- She change her mind?
- What do you think?

103
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,267
- So what's our next move?
- I'll focus on the bridge,

104
00:07:58,268 --> 00:07:59,947
you talk to the Indian affairs.

105
00:07:59,948 --> 00:08:02,306
The sooner that Whitehall's
tribe gets recognized,

106
00:08:02,307 --> 00:08:04,427
the sooner they can
break ground on that casino.

107
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:05,986
Yes sir.

108
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,987
Maybe it will help me, you know?

109
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,027
If I talk about it
more in the open.

110
00:08:11,028 --> 00:08:13,307
I mean that's what
your interview did.

111
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:16,147
When I called. When I could
say those things out loud.

112
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:18,547
Well, we don't want you
to feel obligated.

113
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:21,386
I know the press
hasn't left you alone.

114
00:08:21,387 --> 00:08:25,506
If they're going to keep taking pictures
of me, I should at least say something.

115
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:27,266
Well, that's only going
to become more intense

116
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:29,147
when McGinnis gets closer
to his court-marshal.

117
00:08:29,148 --> 00:08:31,786
Yeah, I know.
I'm prepared.

118
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:35,347
If you come and speak to the
Armed Services Committee, tell your story,

119
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,427
I feel confident
we can get it to a vote.

120
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:40,147
- I'd be too much coverage to ignore it.
- And you think it will pass?

121
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:42,466
- We need to get it through committee
first. - But let's be clear, Megan,

122
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:43,987
it's not just the testimony.

123
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,346
We'll need you to do
a media avail after.

124
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:48,266
Photo ops, a statement.

125
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,427
- OK.
- You won't be alone.

126
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:52,988
- I'll be standing right next to you.
- And so will I.

127
00:08:53,468 --> 00:08:55,468
OK.

128
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:00,827
Do you think we're doing the right thing?
Hauling her in front of the cameras?

129
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:04,227
We have to trust her
when she says she wants to.

130
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:09,707
But it's very important that
the White House backs us
up on this, not just you.

131
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:13,346
I'm not sure if Garrett
will get involved publicly.

132
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:15,467
Well, can you talk to him?

133
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:18,187
We haven't been doing much
talking about anything lately.

134
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:25,186
Things haven't
gotten any better?

135
00:09:25,187 --> 00:09:28,787
We haven't said a word
to each other in almost a week.

136
00:09:28,788 --> 00:09:31,306
- I've been there, it's awful.
- With Frank?

137
00:09:31,307 --> 00:09:33,507
- Sure.
- What did you do?

138
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:36,347
We saw someone.

139
00:09:36,348 --> 00:09:39,667
You mean a therapist?

140
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:42,826
- Weren't you worried about exposure?
- He was a minister.

141
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:48,626
He wasn't exactly a therapist. It was more
like a spiritual guidance, type thing.

142
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:50,827
The only difference
was that he had a degree.

143
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:54,067
I could put you in touch.

144
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:55,627
It's too risky.

145
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:58,827
Just a suggestion.

146
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:00,546
Let me know if
you change your mind.

147
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:03,026
Thanks.

148
00:10:03,027 --> 00:10:05,866
In the meantime,
can you try to talk to Garrett?

149
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:08,347
We really need
his support with this.

150
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:09,827
I will.

151
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,587
Yes?

152
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:22,908
Show him in please.

153
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:38,268
- Remy.
- So formal.

154
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:43,107
Would you have a seat?

155
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:45,226
Shouldn't keep
your interns so late.

156
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,466
You and I might not
have lives but they do.

157
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:50,067
When there's work to be done,
we work. They know that.

158
00:10:51,828 --> 00:10:55,227
- Why am I here at ten at night?
- Where's the GOP getting their money?

159
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:59,067
- That's a $25 million question isn't it?
- You must have an idea.

160
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:02,227
- What makes you think that?
- Because you know things.

161
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:05,627
That's why Glendon Hill
made you partner.

162
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:09,348
Most of our clients are Democrats,
I'm just as much in the dark as you are.

163
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:12,627
I'm losing in my district, Remy.

164
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,827
I wish I could help you.

165
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:17,627
Even if I pull off
a win, it doesn't matter.

166
00:11:17,628 --> 00:11:21,549
The GOP takes the house,
I lose my spot in the leadership,

167
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,907
this office, everything
I've worked for.

168
00:11:24,828 --> 00:11:25,828
I feel for you.

169
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:28,188
But you want information
I don't have.

170
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:37,346
Are you upset about
the last time we saw each other?

171
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:40,825
Not at all. I made myself clear.

172
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:44,828
Can we talk?
No work, no politics.

173
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:51,586
We can talk about
whatever you want.

174
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:57,107
I've never... been with anyone
for more than six months.

175
00:11:57,108 --> 00:12:01,186
When I was in the army I was
always on the move and, um...

176
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,667
Since I've been in Congress,
I just haven't had time.

177
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:09,549
I wasn't asking to marry you.
Just to be more than company for a night.

178
00:12:10,707 --> 00:12:12,308
Do you still want that?

179
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:14,827
I'm here, aren't I?

180
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,987
There would have
to be clear boundaries.

181
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:22,347
Whatever we have privately couldn't
affect our professional relationship.

182
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:31,587
Then we shouldn't be having this
conversation in your office.

183
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:36,666
I'm glad we had this meeting.

184
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:40,066
If you'd like to have
another, just call me.

185
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:42,467
We can leave the
secretaries out of it.

186
00:12:54,746 --> 00:12:56,746
I'll review this
and have Linda get in touch.

187
00:12:56,747 --> 00:12:58,348
Thank you, sir.

188
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,626
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Hi, Frank.

189
00:13:08,627 --> 00:13:13,146
I left my bourbon at home,
but you have time for some coffee?

190
00:13:13,147 --> 00:13:14,828
I'm fine, you go ahead.

191
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,066
I wanted to talk to you
about the Port Jefferson Bridge.

192
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,067
Linda told me you two spoke.

193
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,026
Have you reconsidered?

194
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:27,906
It's not the right time, Frank.

195
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:33,666
We'll find some other project to showcase
our program once tensions subside.

196
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,186
During the campaign,
you repeatedly promised

197
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:37,945
to address critical
infrastructure.

198
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:40,187
We're well into
your second year.

199
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:43,588
This project is ready to go, you don't
want to have to start from square one.

200
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,986
I'm thinking midterms.

201
00:13:45,987 --> 00:13:48,066
We have to project consistency.

202
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:53,346
Except people don't vote for consistency,
they vote for concrete progress.

203
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:57,346
Linda mentioned that you seemed
obsessed with this bridge.

204
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:59,186
I'm beginning to think
she was right.

205
00:13:59,187 --> 00:14:02,587
The backstabbing,
vomit-inducing bitch.

206
00:14:02,588 --> 00:14:04,627
Is she right, Frank?

207
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:07,668
Tell me why this bridge
is so important to you.

208
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:12,747
- I wanted to insulate you from this...
- From what?

209
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:21,226
You asked me to back channel with
the Chinese and I have continued to do so.

210
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:25,026
No, I told you to stop back
channeling and you did anyway?

211
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:28,787
- Without informing me, Frank...
- I needed to distance you.

212
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:31,387
There are issues that
a president cannot be aware of.

213
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:34,585
- What issues...
- But, what I can tell you...

214
00:14:34,586 --> 00:14:36,666
...is that the building
of this bridge

215
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,108
directly affects our ability to
combat the Republicans in the midterms.

216
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,666
- Have the Chinese...
- Mr. President, you are asking questions

217
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,747
you do not want the answers to.

218
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:47,947
All right, how much
danger are we in, Frank?

219
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:50,548
None if we end this
conversation right now.

220
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:57,066
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing control
over my goddamn administration.

221
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:59,946
You're under pressure, sir,
but you're not losing control.

222
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:04,827
You have people who are
looking out for you: me, Linda, your wife.

223
00:15:04,828 --> 00:15:07,028
I might be losing control
of her too.

224
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:10,907
I shouldn't have said that...

225
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:14,466
Of course she wants
the best for me.

226
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:17,666
Has Claire said anything?
I know they talk.

227
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:21,826
Not much... just that things
have been a little rocky.

228
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:25,427
Well, that's an understatement.

229
00:15:25,428 --> 00:15:30,946
You have the most difficult job on earth.
It would take a toll on any marriage.

230
00:15:30,947 --> 00:15:34,786
Which is why I'm urging you
to reconsider your decision on the bridge.

231
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:39,986
And I'd say that not as
your vice president... but as your friend.

232
00:15:39,987 --> 00:15:42,147
Because I care about you.

233
00:15:50,187 --> 00:15:52,587
All right, I'll...
I'll have another look at it.

234
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:55,747
Thank you, Mr...

235
00:15:58,227 --> 00:15:59,947
Thank you, Garrett.

236
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:06,386
- Mr. Frost.
- Morning.

237
00:16:06,387 --> 00:16:08,986
We filed all our paperwork
back in 2006.

238
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:11,268
We dotted all of our I's
and crossed all of our T's.

239
00:16:11,269 --> 00:16:15,347
There's over 317 applications. Each one
requires at least a year to review.

240
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:17,706
- You need more researchers.
- It's not just personnel.

241
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:20,426
There's travel, filing,
administration...

242
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:22,587
Name the figure.

243
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:24,586
Twelve, thirteen million.

244
00:16:24,587 --> 00:16:26,626
That requires an appropriation
from Congress.

245
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:28,186
The vice president
can make that happen.

246
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,946
But first we need you
to recognize the Ugaya tribe.

247
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:34,866
Our policy is first come, first serve.
There are other applications which we...

248
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,186
Daniel Lanagin disenrolled us.

249
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:40,066
We lost our right
to BIA benefits.

250
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,426
Is this more about
starting a casino?

251
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:43,265
It's about correcting
an injustice.

252
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:45,426
I can't be getting involved
in inner-tribal conflicts.

253
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:48,267
Yes, you can.
If you want that appropriation.

254
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:53,026
Two months. Maybe less
if all the ancestry holds up.

255
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:55,066
Lanagin knows.

256
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,386
And what did he say?

257
00:16:56,387 --> 00:17:00,066
He wants to meet.
But on his turf this time.

258
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:03,386
I need a way to get to Missouri
without attracting any attention.

259
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:06,506
Womack's district is in Kansas City.
It's not far from the casino.

260
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:09,707
See if he has any events
coming up: rallies fund-raisers...

261
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:16,706
How's it coming with
cosponsors for Claire's bill?

262
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:19,427
Terrific, we're making
great progress.

263
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:29,267
One speech, it'll send a message to
Congress...

264
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:31,226
And a message to
the joint chiefs that I'm trampling on...

265
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:34,145
Twenty-four thousand assaults
last year, only 3,000 reported because...

266
00:17:34,146 --> 00:17:36,106
- I know the figures.
- Do you know how many suicides

267
00:17:36,107 --> 00:17:38,786
- result from the trauma...
- It's not the question of statistics...

268
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:40,865
- This bill will save lives.
- Can we discuss this later?

269
00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:43,547
- I had to schedule this meeting, Garrett.
- It's the middle of the day.

270
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:47,146
- You know very well...
- Don't make me lobby you when I go home...

271
00:17:47,147 --> 00:17:49,946
I'm sorry to interrupt Mr. President.
The secretary general's here.

272
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:51,386
I got two more minutes.

273
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,867
It's 12:30, he was schedule
for 12:15.

274
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,387
I'll go.

275
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:01,066
You were supposed to
tell me to stay.

276
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,587
But it's nice to know
I'm worth at least two minutes.

277
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:14,107
Hi, Tricia.

278
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:16,427
No, please,
don't worry about it.

279
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,227
Oh, that's awful.

280
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:27,667
Yes, of course, let me
grab his number for you.

281
00:18:29,147 --> 00:18:30,467
Mm-hm.

282
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,787
Right.

283
00:18:39,387 --> 00:18:41,947
His name is Dr. Thomas Larkin.

284
00:18:41,948 --> 00:18:47,265
At 202-251-6258

285
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:49,627
And if you'd like, I can
give him a call before hand

286
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,667
and let him know
you'll be reaching out.

287
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:56,866
OK, you let me know
if I can be of any help.

288
00:18:58,147 --> 00:18:59,987
Good night, Tricia.

289
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,347
What do you think?

290
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:05,107
We'll see.

291
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:11,707
The idea is to take color theory
and turn it on its head.

292
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,707
Break all the rules.

293
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:17,467
They're gorgeous.

294
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:19,667
Who'd you say your client is?

295
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:21,106
I didn't.

296
00:19:21,107 --> 00:19:22,986
I was just wondering
if maybe I knew them.

297
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:24,746
You don't.

298
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,667
Let's say he's a collector
always on the lookout for new talent.

299
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:32,426
I understand you work
for Adam Galloway.

300
00:19:32,427 --> 00:19:36,065
Yeah... it's a way
to pay the bills.

301
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:39,346
I mean, Adam's a good photographer
if you like that kind of thing.

302
00:19:39,347 --> 00:19:41,985
I'm much more
interested in form.

303
00:19:41,986 --> 00:19:46,106
- How much for all of them?
- What?

304
00:19:46,107 --> 00:19:50,625
I'd like to buy them all.

305
00:19:50,626 --> 00:19:53,466
<i>Missouri is the</i>
<i>"Show Me State" for a reason.</i>

306
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:58,266
<i>We need to show the rest of America
that we can keep our leadership intact.</i>

307
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:01,907
It is a pleasure to look out
and see a room full of smiling faces.

308
00:20:01,908 --> 00:20:04,706
That's not something you see
everyday in Washington DC.

309
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:07,226
- What did your editor say?
<i>- Five thousand words.</i>

310
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:08,386
This should be twice that.

311
00:20:08,387 --> 00:20:09,626
I could probably
get them to eight,

312
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,426
but I'm gonna need
the First Lady too.

313
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:12,506
Separate interviews.

314
00:20:12,507 --> 00:20:14,505
Let me talk to Mrs. Underwood.

315
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,346
<i>How come you're coming to me</i>
<i>with this instead of Connor?</i>

316
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:19,226
Between you and me, he's out.
He got a job at SpaceX.

317
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:21,225
<i>His choice or was he pushed out?</i>

318
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:23,826
People don't like working with me, Matt.
You may be the only one.

319
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:26,506
I don't like you either. I might
if you give me the First Lady.

320
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:28,225
They'll both be speaking
to armed services tomorrow.

321
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:29,466
<i>Along with Megan Hennessy.</i>

322
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:30,986
<i>She's</i> the one the general...

323
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:32,146
That's right.
I'll set up a one-on-one,

324
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,586
text you for your piece.

325
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:34,826
All right, let me know, man.

326
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:36,306
Anything for the<i> Times,</i> man.

327
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:38,106
Anything for the<i> Times,</i> huh?

328
00:20:38,107 --> 00:20:40,545
Then we get shut out
of donor meetings.

329
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:42,426
The magazine. And yes.

330
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:45,306
Raymond Tusk. Your boss
went to see him last October.

331
00:20:45,307 --> 00:20:47,746
It's in his congressional
travel report.

332
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,985
- Before my time.
- You said they didn't communicate.

333
00:20:49,986 --> 00:20:51,866
- I said, "not to my knowledge."
- We're in Missouri.

334
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:54,626
- He's not one of the donors.
- I can quote you on that?

335
00:20:54,627 --> 00:20:56,786
If you spell my name right.

336
00:20:56,787 --> 00:21:00,626
Now, normally, I don't quote
Northern writers, but every now and then

337
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,586
one of them says something
that makes a lot of sense,

338
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:05,906
and this Emerson fellow
you probably heard of,

339
00:21:05,907 --> 00:21:10,426
once wrote that the only way
to have a friend is to be one.

340
00:21:10,427 --> 00:21:14,586
I think you all know what kind of
a friend Terry has been to this district.

341
00:21:14,587 --> 00:21:18,186
So I am proud to introduce him
today and to call him my friend.

342
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:22,346
Would you please welcome, the majority
leader, Representative Terry Womack.

343
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,147
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

344
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:31,466
We all set?

345
00:21:31,467 --> 00:21:35,425
I told the press you were having some
private meetings with contributors.

346
00:21:35,426 --> 00:21:39,946
- Any protests?
- We're good except for Ayala Sayyad.

347
00:21:41,227 --> 00:21:42,825
Thank you. What's going on?

348
00:21:42,826 --> 00:21:45,747
- Potential blind spot.
- Tell me on the way to the car.

349
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:18,426
Mr. Vice President.

350
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:19,707
Thank you.

351
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:29,227
Calm down. Now.

352
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:32,826
Welcome.

353
00:22:32,827 --> 00:22:36,826
- What a pleasant surprise, Raymond.
- Mr. Vice President.

354
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:39,866
I was expecting to see you
privately today, Daniel.

355
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:43,507
When it's a serious matter
I invite all the chiefs to the circle.

356
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:48,065
Nice pool.

357
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:51,186
I've never swum in
it. The chlorine hurts my eyes.

358
00:22:51,187 --> 00:22:54,066
You're welcome to take
a dip in it if you'd like.

359
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,506
Another time.

360
00:22:56,507 --> 00:22:59,026
Raymond tells me
you're a ribs man.

361
00:22:59,027 --> 00:23:01,306
I've got three of the
choicest pieces of meat

362
00:23:01,307 --> 00:23:05,307
you'll ever see in your life coming out.
You do not want to pass on this.

363
00:23:05,308 --> 00:23:07,265
I won't be here long.

364
00:23:07,266 --> 00:23:10,466
So the Ugaya band.

365
00:23:11,507 --> 00:23:13,786
Tip of the iceberg.

366
00:23:13,787 --> 00:23:16,746
- They're not a real tribe.
- They're about to be.

367
00:23:16,747 --> 00:23:21,146
No, they're a bunch of troublemakers
with too much hope on their hands.

368
00:23:21,147 --> 00:23:24,507
Once they get recognized,
they're gonna have their own casino.

369
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:25,985
In two years... at best?

370
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:28,306
You better enjoy this pool
while you can.

371
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:31,227
I don't think your casino
can stand that sort of competition.

372
00:23:33,386 --> 00:23:37,626
Who do you think Whitehall
called as soon as he left the BIA?

373
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:42,186
You offer them a casino two years from
now, we offered what they really want.

374
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,825
Reenrollment in my tribe.

375
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:48,826
A tip of your iceberg
is melting, Frank.

376
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:53,906
And you do not have time
on your side so how about this...?

377
00:23:53,907 --> 00:23:57,586
You help me repair
my relationship with Garrett,

378
00:23:57,587 --> 00:24:01,707
Dan and I here get the money
flowing back in the right direction.

379
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,626
How about this...?

380
00:24:06,627 --> 00:24:09,546
I get the BIA to investigate
both of you.

381
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:11,665
Connection to Feng, laundering...

382
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,066
You could, but you won't.

383
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:15,745
You don't dare.

384
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,505
My money has been going
to the Democrats for nine years.

385
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,666
You were the whip
for all of them.

386
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,266
You implicate us,
you implicate yourself.

387
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:25,345
And everyone in the leadership.

388
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:27,706
- Ah, here comes the steak.
- Oh...

389
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:30,985
Now you are going to enjoy this,
Frank. There you go.

390
00:24:30,986 --> 00:24:32,986
Thank you.

391
00:24:32,987 --> 00:24:35,905
Now dig in, Frank.
Before the flies get to it.

392
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:38,266
- I'll pass, thanks.
- Are you sure?

393
00:24:38,267 --> 00:24:41,466
This is soy-fed Matsusaka beef.

394
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:45,626
You know, my ancestors would've
prayed to this heifer to honor her spirit.

395
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:49,985
But at 200 bucks a pound,
I figure... fuck tradition.

396
00:24:49,986 --> 00:24:52,226
Come on, live a little, Frank.

397
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:55,745
Mr. Vice President.

398
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:58,266
Not my vice president.

399
00:24:58,267 --> 00:25:00,586
You're on sovereign land.

400
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,146
Dogs are so predictable,
aren't they?

401
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:23,386
Set up a meeting with Walker. Tonight,
if possible. I should be back by six.

402
00:25:23,387 --> 00:25:25,505
- <i> Lanagin didn't budge?</i>
- He reenrolled the Ugaya.

403
00:25:25,506 --> 00:25:28,266
<i>- We have to get the bridge approved now.</i>
<i>- </i> I'll call Linda.

404
00:25:28,267 --> 00:25:30,826
<i>Bypass her, I don't</i>
<i>want her in the meeting.</i>

405
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:33,265
- I'm on it.
- Thanks.

406
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:37,626
Meechum, get in touch with the plane
have them make ribs for the flight back.

407
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:38,667
Yes sir.

408
00:27:05,747 --> 00:27:07,465
Mr. Vice President,
do you have a moment?

409
00:27:07,466 --> 00:27:08,906
I'm sorry, the president
asked to see me.

410
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:11,866
No he didn't, you requested the meeting
and I took it off the schedule.

411
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:14,387
- You did what?
- Let's go in your office.

412
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:19,745
You lied, Frank. You said
you would let the bridge go

413
00:27:19,746 --> 00:27:21,985
and then you went behind my back
just like you're trying to do now.

414
00:27:21,986 --> 00:27:24,585
- I do not require your permission!
- No, but you should involve me.

415
00:27:24,586 --> 00:27:27,585
The president and the vice president
have issues they must discuss privately.

416
00:27:27,586 --> 00:27:30,426
When you are secretive it prevents
me from being able to do my job.

417
00:27:30,427 --> 00:27:33,586
And when you cancel meetings it
prevents me from being able to do mine.

418
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:35,625
Which is why I wanted to talk
so we can work things out.

419
00:27:35,626 --> 00:27:37,385
- I will not waste my time...
- We should be working together...

420
00:27:37,386 --> 00:27:38,826
...inflating your sense
of self-importance!

421
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:41,505
- Excuse me?
- How many elections have you won?!

422
00:27:41,506 --> 00:27:43,945
How many congressional
committees have you chaired?!

423
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:45,466
Would you even be working
in the White House

424
00:27:45,467 --> 00:27:47,346
if I hadn't recommended you
during the campaign?

425
00:27:47,347 --> 00:27:50,705
I returned that favor and then
some. Look where your desk is now!

426
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:52,026
And I'd say we're even.

427
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:53,906
And if you want
to maintain my respect,

428
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:55,425
you're going about it all wrong.

429
00:27:55,426 --> 00:27:56,946
I asked you in here
to work out a situation...

430
00:27:56,947 --> 00:27:58,385
You didn't ask, you demanded!

431
00:27:58,386 --> 00:27:59,745
I will not be left out
of the loop,

432
00:27:59,746 --> 00:28:01,586
I'm the president's
chief of staff.

433
00:28:01,587 --> 00:28:05,746
You call this being chief of staff?
Micromanaging his date book?

434
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:08,146
I'd say that's more
of a glorified scheduler.

435
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:10,785
The White House would fall off
its rails without me doing my job.

436
00:28:10,786 --> 00:28:12,666
- Are you certain about that?
- Yes, I am.

437
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:15,066
I look out
for the president 24/7.

438
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:17,705
I keep him informed.
I keep his priorities straight.

439
00:28:17,706 --> 00:28:19,866
We did just fine before you
became vice president, Frank.

440
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,906
All right, let's go over
to the Oval Office right now

441
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:25,025
and ask the president to choose:
his chief of staff or his vice president.

442
00:28:25,026 --> 00:28:27,507
I know what the answer would be.
You wanna go?

443
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,345
I didn't think so.

444
00:28:30,346 --> 00:28:35,027
Now I will see the president
tomorrow morning, schedule or no.

445
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:40,026
And please, turn out the lights
before you leave.

446
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:46,826
I thought you went home.

447
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:50,546
No, not yet.
Um, do you have a moment?

448
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:52,225
Is there something wrong?

449
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:55,145
I know you are reconsidering
the bridge project and I want...

450
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:56,945
I'm reviewing it.
I'll make my decision soon.

451
00:28:56,946 --> 00:28:58,945
But you already
made a decision, sir.

452
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,345
I'm concerned that you
are overthinking this one.

453
00:29:01,346 --> 00:29:03,465
- If we backtrack...
- Did I not make myself clear?

454
00:29:03,466 --> 00:29:05,746
I'm just trying to offer
my advice, sir.

455
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:10,225
Which I've heard. And which I don't
need to hear again but... thank you.

456
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:13,425
I know the vice president spoke
to you yesterday and in fairness...

457
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,546
You know I value your input,
Linda,

458
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:17,985
but when I say I've heard it,
you need to know I mean that.

459
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:19,425
Of course, sir.

460
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,546
- Is there anything else?
- No, sir.

461
00:29:22,547 --> 00:29:24,786
- Good night.
- Good night.

462
00:29:34,946 --> 00:29:36,545
You disappointed me.

463
00:29:36,546 --> 00:29:38,546
I told you it would take time.

464
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:39,826
Any leads?

465
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:42,065
I've been going over
his state senate days,

466
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,546
it's a slow process.

467
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:44,945
I have to be thorough.

468
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:46,665
So how is it that
I've found more in two days

469
00:29:46,666 --> 00:29:48,225
than you have in two months?

470
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:51,825
- What do you mean?
- I've had to do your job for you.

471
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:53,226
You found something?

472
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,706
I'm the one who's supposed
to ask that question.

473
00:29:55,707 --> 00:29:58,106
What'd you find?
Maybe I can help.

474
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,985
Are you working for Frank?

475
00:30:01,986 --> 00:30:07,025
- Yeah, as his communications director.
- No, are you working for him?

476
00:30:07,026 --> 00:30:08,665
Come on.

477
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,585
He couldn't pay me a fraction
of what you're offering.

478
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:13,865
- Don't lie to me. - Look, if you've lost
confidence in my ability...

479
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:14,986
Stop fucking around.

480
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,546
You made the wrong choice, Seth.

481
00:30:22,546 --> 00:30:24,226
I don't think so.

482
00:30:26,346 --> 00:30:29,105
You're nothing.
You're a parasite.

483
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:32,347
So are you Danton.
Just in a nicer suit.

484
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:40,546
Do you know what it might be?

485
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:45,386
Well, keep your ear
to the ground.

486
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,267
That was Seth.

487
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:57,547
He thinks Remy may have
something on us.

488
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:04,345
- What?
- He doesn't know.

489
00:31:04,346 --> 00:31:07,706
- Do you think it could be...
- No.

490
00:31:07,707 --> 00:31:12,345
If it's anything I'm sure it's innocuous.
Nothing we can't weather.

491
00:31:12,346 --> 00:31:16,266
But my bet is they're bluffing.
Just to make us paranoid.

492
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:22,746
But he's a dangerous man,
isn't he? Raymond?

493
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:26,585
We can be dangerous too.

494
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,066
When we need to be.

495
00:32:11,585 --> 00:32:13,186
Don't stop.

496
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:18,666
I used to be a call girl.

497
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:25,946
I had to get away from it
and that's why I came here.

498
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:33,945
It's a lot of stuff
you don't know about me.

499
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:36,347
You don't have to
say anything you don't want to.

500
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:44,785
When you tapped on
my shoulder on the bus,

501
00:32:44,786 --> 00:32:47,105
there was something...

502
00:32:53,627 --> 00:32:55,825
Your eyes.

503
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:58,506
- That sounds really, really dumb.
- No.

504
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,464
Um...

505
00:33:02,465 --> 00:33:06,227
I don't know, I felt like...
I wanted to tell you everything.

506
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:08,745
Like...

507
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:12,064
...that I could trust you
even though I didn't know you.

508
00:33:12,065 --> 00:33:13,186
You can.

509
00:33:17,226 --> 00:33:19,387
I never trusted anyone.

510
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,746
Have you ever loved anyone?

511
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:28,987
No.

512
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:36,465
I've never expected
much from the world. It's ugly.

513
00:33:36,466 --> 00:33:38,346
It's not a fair place.

514
00:33:40,347 --> 00:33:42,186
I'm happy to have what I have.

515
00:33:44,826 --> 00:33:46,826
I'm glad I have this.

516
00:34:17,866 --> 00:34:19,745
I've thought it all out.

517
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:23,186
And there's a way to do it
so we don't risk any exposure.

518
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:26,587
Do we have to talk
about this now?

519
00:34:27,786 --> 00:34:29,705
I'm beat.

520
00:34:29,706 --> 00:34:31,466
My brain is f...

521
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:34,906
Yes, we do.

522
00:34:36,545 --> 00:34:38,745
Because it's our marriage.

523
00:34:38,746 --> 00:34:42,907
If we're going to survive
the next two years... or six.

524
00:34:43,826 --> 00:34:46,025
We need to do something.

525
00:34:46,026 --> 00:34:48,905
We should be each others'
support system.

526
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:52,465
Not cause each other stress.

527
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,744
The foundation of this White
House is not brick and mortar.

528
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,706
It's us, Garrett.

529
00:35:02,387 --> 00:35:04,625
This is important to me.

530
00:35:04,626 --> 00:35:06,946
And I want it
to be important to you.

531
00:35:12,906 --> 00:35:15,104
I have to trust
that whatever you're managing,

532
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:18,865
to whatever extent you choose
not to inform me, that I'm neither at risk,

533
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,505
nor passively condoning
something blatantly illegal.

534
00:35:21,506 --> 00:35:23,305
Any risk solely falls on me,

535
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:26,225
and you can't be accused of condoning
what you're not aware of.

536
00:35:26,226 --> 00:35:28,306
Being not aware,
is just as egregious.

537
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:31,945
Not in this case. I'm steering the
ship away from the rocks, not toward them.

538
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,946
Then I'll call the committee
for foreign investments.

539
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:35,987
You're making
the right decision, sir.

540
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:39,747
I have another difficult
decision to make.

541
00:35:41,025 --> 00:35:44,465
Linda submitted her resignation.

542
00:35:44,466 --> 00:35:48,905
I was furious with her. That was
a very manipulative move.

543
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:51,305
I can speculate
as to why she made it.

544
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:53,825
Are her complaints valid?

545
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:56,505
I have a very biased view
on that subject.

546
00:35:56,506 --> 00:35:59,145
Well, I've heard hers.
Give me yours.

547
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:02,586
Linda and I don't always agree.

548
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:06,185
But she's been very loyal to you,
and a more than competent chief of staff.

549
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:07,986
So you think I should keep her?

550
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:12,985
Do I think she oversteps
sometimes? Yes.

551
00:36:12,986 --> 00:36:16,105
Does she wrongly equate
her advice with mine? Often.

552
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:20,105
But... the question that occurs
to me is not about Linda.

553
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:24,705
Let's say you refuse her resignation,
if this gets out, and it could,

554
00:36:24,706 --> 00:36:29,185
won't you be sending a signal
to anybody who works for you that...

555
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:32,465
...you can be leveraged.

556
00:36:32,466 --> 00:36:36,826
She offered her resignation.
She's already gone even if she stays.

557
00:36:49,345 --> 00:36:51,826
Megan. They're ready.

558
00:36:51,827 --> 00:36:54,465
I don't know,
my hands are shaking.

559
00:36:54,466 --> 00:36:56,985
You can do this, Megan.
I'll be there.

560
00:36:56,986 --> 00:36:59,705
I get panic attacks sometimes.

561
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:01,745
- You're afraid you'll get one?
- Yeah.

562
00:37:01,746 --> 00:37:04,985
OK, why don't we ask for a couple
more minutes, that's not a problem.

563
00:37:04,986 --> 00:37:07,304
It's not about that,
they just come.

564
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:09,345
I can't control them.

565
00:37:11,466 --> 00:37:13,306
I don't want to do this.

566
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,945
OK, Megan, there's some of the most
senior congressmen and women in the room,

567
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,984
and they press, they've shown up
just to hear from you.

568
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:24,505
- I know.
- OK, I don't want to pressure you,

569
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:27,626
but a lot of planning
has gone into this.

570
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,546
Please don't make me do this.

571
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:34,225
We're not making you
do anything.

572
00:37:34,226 --> 00:37:36,305
Then can I just go back home?
Back to Chicago?

573
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:37,984
Listen, you have nerves,
that's understandable.

574
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:39,585
I don't wanna fucking do it, OK?

575
00:37:39,586 --> 00:37:41,505
I understand, it's OK. But
if you back out now, Megan...

576
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:43,305
- This isn't about me at all, is it?
- ...this is not good for us.

577
00:37:43,306 --> 00:37:45,425
It hurts us, it makes us
look unorganized.

578
00:37:45,426 --> 00:37:46,784
This is about your
fucking moment to shine.

579
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:48,305
You don't care if do...

580
00:37:48,306 --> 00:37:51,226
I do care. I do care.

581
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,146
It is about me and about you!

582
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:01,425
And for whatever reason, we both
decided to share what happened to us.

583
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:03,025
And it mattered
and people listened

584
00:38:03,026 --> 00:38:04,625
so let's go in
and finish what we started.

585
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:06,385
- I can't, I'm not the right person.
- Come on, Megan.

586
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:08,985
You know what I did last night?
I picked up some guy at a bar.

587
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:12,346
A total stranger. I let him
fuck my brains out at the hotel.

588
00:38:12,347 --> 00:38:13,945
Night before, same thing.

589
00:38:13,946 --> 00:38:15,865
I can't stop.
It's my only way to fucking...

590
00:38:15,866 --> 00:38:18,667
Jesus, I fucking hate this when
my hands shake like this and I...

591
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:27,264
It's OK.
It's OK.

592
00:38:27,265 --> 00:38:28,864
I'm not who you want
to be your poster girl.

593
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:30,985
It's OK. You don't have to be.
You don't have to be.

594
00:38:30,986 --> 00:38:32,265
I'm sorry I'm letting you down.

595
00:38:32,266 --> 00:38:33,984
It's OK, you're not
letting me down.

596
00:38:33,985 --> 00:38:35,865
It's OK. It's OK.

597
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:37,625
When will it become official?

598
00:38:37,626 --> 00:38:39,385
<i>President will make</i>
<i>his call this afternoon.</i>

599
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:42,504
<i>Official approval will be</i>
<i>announced in the morning.</i>

600
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:44,465
No revisions to the agreement?

601
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:48,064
<i>None. Everything is</i>
<i>as spelled out in the proposal.</i>

602
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:50,625
Then I will uphold
my end of the bargain.

603
00:38:50,626 --> 00:38:52,265
<i>The money will be cut off.</i>

604
00:38:52,266 --> 00:38:55,345
You required proof.
Now we want some.

605
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:58,025
- <i> What sort?</i>
- Of your commitment.

606
00:38:58,026 --> 00:38:59,865
You kill your
co-venture with Tusk.

607
00:38:59,866 --> 00:39:02,385
<i>- </i> That was never part of the deal.
<i>- It is now.</i>

608
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:05,585
<i>The refinery can't proceed</i>
<i>while we're in a trade wall.</i>

609
00:39:05,586 --> 00:39:09,425
We want you to kill it for good.
And we want you to kill it today.

610
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:11,186
Make the call to Tusk.

611
00:39:25,386 --> 00:39:27,584
<i>It's business hours,</i>
<i>is this a business call?</i>

612
00:39:27,585 --> 00:39:29,145
No...

613
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:31,145
<i>I was hoping it wasn't.</i>

614
00:39:31,146 --> 00:39:33,865
- What are you doing tonight?
- Just about to get on a plane.

615
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:35,304
<i>Where to?</i>

616
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:37,344
Boundaries, remember?

617
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:39,986
- Work related.
- <i> I don't take vacation.</i>

618
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,465
Can you tell me
when you'll be back?

619
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:45,864
Tomorrow. It's a quick trip.

620
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:47,346
<i>Do you want to have dinner?</i>

621
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:49,785
I'd like that.

622
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:54,226
Bring your carry-on.
You can stay over after.

623
00:40:01,906 --> 00:40:04,945
- Yes.
- Do you have a moment?

624
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:06,665
Absolutely.

625
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:09,704
The president accepted
my resignation an hour ago.

626
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:11,345
Yes, I know.

627
00:40:11,346 --> 00:40:13,105
I almost told him
that I changed my mind,

628
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:14,784
but I realized
it wouldn't make any difference.

629
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:17,105
For whatever it's worth,
I did bring up your loyalty

630
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:20,185
and how good you are at your job.
Not that he needed me to remind him.

631
00:40:20,186 --> 00:40:22,865
And I will always be grateful
you recommended me.

632
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:24,585
It has been quite a ride.

633
00:40:24,586 --> 00:40:26,745
Shorter than I would've hoped,
but I have a long career ahead.

634
00:40:26,746 --> 00:40:29,225
- No doubt.
- And just so you know,

635
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,465
I don't plan on making
any fuss in the press.

636
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:34,545
You'll hear nothing but
my praises if I'm asked.

637
00:40:34,546 --> 00:40:37,385
I have something for you.
A few weeks ago,

638
00:40:37,386 --> 00:40:40,065
the president told me about
a dinner he had at your house.

639
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:42,624
He went on and on
about your Civil War models.

640
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:45,105
How much fun he had painting
the toy soldiers with you.

641
00:40:45,106 --> 00:40:48,465
This was given to me by the
director of the Smithsonian.

642
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:51,865
It's the first Medal of Honor
awarded to a Hispanic-American:

643
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:55,226
Corporal Joseph de Castro,
he fought for the Union.

644
00:40:57,066 --> 00:41:00,385
Linda, I don't know what to say.

645
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:03,985
It's clear the president sees you
as a friend, I've never been that to him,

646
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:07,105
but his job is bigger
than friendship.

647
00:41:07,106 --> 00:41:09,264
It's bigger than you and me.

648
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:12,745
I just hope you'll look out for
him the way I've tried to do.

649
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:15,786
I will. And I'll treasure this.

650
00:41:17,185 --> 00:41:19,866
Goodbye, Mr. Vice President.

651
00:41:26,386 --> 00:41:29,905
I've never thought higher of her
than I do at this moment.

652
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:35,705
She lost...
but she played to win.

653
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:40,025
Underwood got the phone.
The refinery's dead. Grayson played us.

654
00:41:40,026 --> 00:41:41,786
We're running out of options.

655
00:41:44,065 --> 00:41:45,665
What do you think Jean?

656
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:48,705
Fuck him!

657
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:51,585
Do it.

658
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:13,306
Thank you.

659
00:42:27,105 --> 00:42:29,345
Thank you for doing this Sandra.

660
00:42:31,905 --> 00:42:33,185
Richard.

661
00:42:37,386 --> 00:42:38,745
How are you, Richard?

662
00:42:38,746 --> 00:42:42,065
He has his good days
and his bad.

663
00:42:42,066 --> 00:42:43,744
This is a good day.

664
00:42:43,745 --> 00:42:45,905
He'd love to spend a few minutes
with you after your meeting.

665
00:42:45,906 --> 00:42:46,945
Of course.

666
00:42:46,946 --> 00:42:48,586
The reverend's in here.

667
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:53,585
- Mrs. Walker.
- Hello.

668
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:56,105
- Mr. President.
- Reverend.

669
00:43:02,545 --> 00:43:04,665
How can I help?

670
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:07,145
You need to get
a fan in here, Francis.

671
00:43:07,146 --> 00:43:09,425
Well, the AC is all the way
up to full blast.

672
00:43:09,426 --> 00:43:11,744
I mean from the fumes, the glue.

673
00:43:11,745 --> 00:43:14,225
Oh, that's half the fun.

674
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:21,705
Megan Hennessy
bailed on us today.

675
00:43:22,785 --> 00:43:23,985
Why?

676
00:43:23,986 --> 00:43:25,824
Her nerves got to her.

677
00:43:25,825 --> 00:43:29,465
And she decided she didn't
want to be in the public eye.

678
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:32,625
- Well, we can
sympathize with that.

679
00:43:32,626 --> 00:43:34,745
That was Doug.

680
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:36,265
Yes.

681
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:41,305
Seth.

682
00:43:41,306 --> 00:43:42,585
I'll call you back.

683
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:43,785
When?

684
00:43:55,310 --> 00:46:08,328
