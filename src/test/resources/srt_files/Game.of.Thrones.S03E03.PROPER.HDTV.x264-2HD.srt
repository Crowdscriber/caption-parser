1
00:00:00,676 --> 00:00:02,122
This march is a distraction.

2
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:05,901
My grandfather's funeral
is not a distraction.

3
00:00:05,935 --> 00:00:08,770
- Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
- No.

4
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:10,273
Then it's a distraction.

5
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:12,809
- They're growing fast.
- Not fast enough.

6
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:15,211
I need an army.

7
00:00:15,246 --> 00:00:16,980
<i>We'll be in Astapor</i>
<i>by nightfall.</i>

8
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:19,750
<i>Some say the Unsullied are the</i>
<i>greatest soldiers in the world.</i>

9
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,719
<i>The greatest slave-soldiers</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

10
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:24,488
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- Thoros of Myr.

11
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:26,958
- Who do you fight for?
- <i>The Brotherhood without Banners.</i>

12
00:00:26,992 --> 00:00:29,093
The lords of Westeros
want to burn the countryside.

13
00:00:29,128 --> 00:00:30,562
We're trying to save it.

14
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,768
- Your sister sent me.
- Yara?

15
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,171
I'll come for you tonight
when the castle sleeps.

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,774
I have been searching
for you, Daenerys Stormborn,

17
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,141
to ask your forgiveness.

18
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,978
I am Barristan Selmy,
Kingsguard to your father.

19
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,846
I will not
fail you again.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,115
<i>- What's wrong with him?</i>
<i>- He's a warg.</i>

21
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,851
<i>He can enter the mind of animals,</i>
<i>see through their eyes.</i>

22
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,653
He's scouting for us.

23
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:55,588
Orell, where were you
this time?

24
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,490
The Fist
of the First Men.

25
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,793
- What did you see?
- Dead crows.

26
00:00:59,827 --> 00:01:03,497
Get up, Tarly.
I forbid you to die.

27
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:05,333
You're responsible for him.

28
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,402
<i>Make sure he gets</i>
<i>back alive.</i>

29
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:10,773
So good to see you
again, Clegane.

30
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:13,409
Girl.

31
00:01:13,443 --> 00:01:14,944
What in seven hells

32
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:17,146
are you doing
with the Stark bitch?

33
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:18,715
Get up.

34
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:23,853
Ah!

35
00:01:23,887 --> 00:01:26,155
Let us go and my father will pay
you whatever you want.

36
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,824
Enough to buy me
a new head?

<i>If I may, nephew,</i>

41
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,912
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

42
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,148
at the Stone Mill
which may have some bearing--

43
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:44,484
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

44
00:05:44,518 --> 00:05:47,353
And don't call him "nephew."
He is your king.

45
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:48,821
Robb knows
I meant him no disr--

46
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:52,358
You're lucky
I'm not your king.

47
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,557
I wouldn't let you wave
your blunders around

48
00:05:54,582 --> 00:05:56,096
like a victory flag.

49
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:58,732
My blunder sent
Tywin's mad dog

50
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,902
scurrying back to Casterly Rock with
his tail between his legs.

51
00:06:01,937 --> 00:06:04,072
I think King Robb understands
we're not gonna win this war

52
00:06:04,106 --> 00:06:05,740
if he's the only one
winning any battles.

53
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:07,255
No, there's glory enough
to go around.

54
00:06:07,276 --> 00:06:09,144
It's not about glory.

55
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,582
Your instructions were to wait
for him to come to you.

56
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:15,050
I seized an opportunity.

57
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,985
What value was the mill?

58
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:19,220
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

59
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,588
<i>Is he there now?</i>

60
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:22,824
Of course not.
We took the fight to him.

61
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:24,091
He could not withstand us.

62
00:06:24,126 --> 00:06:27,327
I wanted to draw
the Mountain into the west,

63
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:31,565
into our country where
we could surround him and kill him.

64
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,701
I wanted him to chase us,

65
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:37,204
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

66
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:39,439
without a strategic thought
in his head.

67
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:42,476
I could have that head
on a spike by now.

68
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,348
Instead, I have a mill.

69
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,752
<i>We took hostages.</i>

70
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:55,489
Willem Lannister.
Martyn Lannister.

71
00:06:55,524 --> 00:06:58,026
Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

72
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,495
Martyn is 15,
I believe.

73
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:07,904
Tywin Lannister
has my sisters.

74
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,872
Have I sued for peace?

75
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:11,407
No.

76
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:12,842
Do you think
he'll sue for peace

77
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:15,979
because we have
his father's

78
00:07:16,013 --> 00:07:18,881
brother's
great-grandsons?

79
00:07:23,587 --> 00:07:25,054
No.

80
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:27,089
How many men
did you lose?

81
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:29,825
208.

82
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:32,127
But for every man we lost,
the Lannisters--

83
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:35,097
We need our men more
than Tywin needs his!

84
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:43,239
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:45,642
- I didn't know.
- You would have.

86
00:07:45,676 --> 00:07:48,912
Right here today at this gathering
if you had been patient.

87
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:52,248
We seem to be running
short of patience here.

88
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:54,717
You know who isn't?

89
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,987
Tywin Lannister.

90
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:52,438
Intimate.
Lovely table.

91
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:55,274
<i>Better chairs than the old</i>
<i>small council chamber.</i>

92
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:58,744
Conveniently close
to your own quarters. I like it.

93
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,614
What news of Jaime?

94
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:07,886
20,000 unwashed
Northerners

95
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,955
have known about
his escape for weeks.

96
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:12,357
<i>Collectively, you control</i>
<i>more spies and informants</i>

97
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,292
than the rest
of the world combined.

98
00:10:14,327 --> 00:10:16,228
Do you mean to tell me
that none of you

99
00:10:16,262 --> 00:10:18,364
has any notion
of where he is?

100
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:21,367
- We are trying, my lord.
- Try harder.

101
00:10:23,704 --> 00:10:25,638
<i>What do we have, then?</i>

102
00:10:25,673 --> 00:10:28,542
Robb Stark and most of his
bannermen are in Riverrun

103
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:32,345
for the funeral of his grandfather
Lord Hoster Tully.

104
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:37,483
In Stark's absence,
Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal,

105
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:41,086
which would seem to make
him Lord of Harrenhal,

106
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,240
- in practice if not in name.
- <i>Well, let him have it.</i>

107
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:45,122
The name suits
our purposes

108
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,159
far more than that
useless pile of rubble.

109
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:51,295
The Lord of Harrenhal will make a
worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

110
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,265
For which I am extremely
grateful to you, my lord.

111
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,901
<i>Lady Arryn and I have known</i>
<i>each other since we were children.</i>

112
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,403
She has always been...

113
00:10:59,437 --> 00:11:01,972
positively predisposed
toward me.

114
00:11:02,007 --> 00:11:05,309
A successful courtship
would make Lord Baelish

115
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:07,144
acting Lord of the Vale.

116
00:11:07,178 --> 00:11:10,014
Titles do seem
to breed titles.

117
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:12,216
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

118
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,018
and bring Lysa Arryn
into the fold.

119
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:17,054
Then the young wolf can add
his own aunt to the list

120
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:18,923
of people who have
taken up arms against him.

121
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:21,760
Far be it from me
to hinder true love,

122
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:26,331
<i>but Lord Baelish's absence</i>
<i>would present certain problems.</i>

123
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:28,266
The royal wedding
may end up

124
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:31,169
being the most expensive
event in living memory.

125
00:11:31,204 --> 00:11:34,339
<i>Summer has ended,</i>
<i>hard days lie ahead.</i>

126
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:38,210
Not a good time to leave the
crown's finances unattended.

127
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:40,412
<i>Fully agreed.</i>

128
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:43,549
Which is why I'm naming you
new Master of Coin.

129
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,484
Master of Coin?

130
00:11:45,552 --> 00:11:48,153
It would appear to be a position
that best suits your talents.

131
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:50,122
I'm quite good
at spending money,

132
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:52,124
but a lifetime
of outrageous wealth

133
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,860
hasn't taught me much
about managing it.

134
00:11:53,894 --> 00:11:57,530
I have no doubt you will
prove equal to this challenge.

135
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:59,265

I hope you're pleased.

145
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,557
If you had armed me,
they never would have taken us.

146
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:27,559
You were armed
when we were taken.

147
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:29,261
I was in chains
if you recall.

148
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,196
Our little match would
have ended quite quick

149
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,164
if my hands
weren't bound.

150
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,501
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

151
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:39,204
what a brilliant swordsman."

152
00:12:39,238 --> 00:12:41,539
You were slower
than I expected.

153
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:43,308
And more predictable.

154
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:44,909
I've been sitting
in a muddy pen

155
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,745
wrapped in chains
for the past year.

156
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,714
And I'm a woman.
I was still beating you.

157
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:51,183
You were not beating me.

158
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,385
Maybe you were as good
as people said...

159
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:55,487
once.

160
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:58,590
Or maybe people just love
to overpraise a famous name.

161
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:05,064
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped.

162
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:06,632
More than once.

163
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,836
None of these fellows have
ever been with a noblewoman.

164
00:13:12,072 --> 00:13:13,740
You'd be wise
not to resist.

165
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:15,842
- Would I?
- They'll knock your teeth out.

166
00:13:15,876 --> 00:13:17,343
You think I care
about my teeth?

167
00:13:17,378 --> 00:13:20,613
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

168
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,618
If you fight them,
they will kill you.

169
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:27,353
Do you understand?

170
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:30,123
I'm the prisoner
of value, not you.

171
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:32,458
Let them have what they want.
What does it matter?

172
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:34,694
- What does it matter?
- Close your eyes.

173
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:36,529
Pretend they're Renly.

174
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:40,566
If you were a woman,
you wouldn't resist?

175
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,901
You'd let them
do what they wanted?

176
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:45,938
If I was a woman,
I'd make them kill me.

177
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,340
But I'm not,
thank the gods.

178
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,980
If I had a proper forge,
I could make it good as new.

179
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:56,915
Doesn't have
to look pretty.

180
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,351
It just has to keep
the arrows out of my heart.

181
00:13:59,385 --> 00:14:01,520
Why are you
helping him?

182
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,755
He takes us prisoner
and now he's our friend?

183
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,391
<i>You're not our prisoner,</i>
<i>little lady.</i>

184
00:14:05,425 --> 00:14:07,560
- What am I?
- Our guest.

185
00:14:07,594 --> 00:14:09,662
No one's put
any chains on you.

186
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:11,431
So I can
walk away, then?

187
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:14,267
These woods aren't safe
for Ned Stark's daughter.

188
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:16,569
You're lucky we found you.

189
00:14:20,173 --> 00:14:24,043
You think you're good with
that bow, you little twat?

190
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:25,644
Better than anyone
you've ever met.

191
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,612
<i>A coward's weapon.</i>

192
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,781
<i>I like to fight up close.</i>

193
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:33,252
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

194
00:14:33,287 --> 00:14:35,622
Why?
So you can kiss him?

195
00:14:35,656 --> 00:14:37,757
You remember the last time
you were here?

196
00:14:39,193 --> 00:14:41,328
Looks like every other
shit inn on the road.

197
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:43,964
Now, apologies,
but you're one ugly fucker

198
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:46,200
and I'd rather not
see you no more.

199
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,606
Watch your head.

200
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,041
Off we go.

201
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:57,378
<i>Walk up!</i>

202
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:03,483
What are you doing?
We're about to leave.

203
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:04,984
I'm staying.

204
00:15:07,188 --> 00:15:09,556
You're what?

205
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,858
I baked some brown bread
for the innkeep

206
00:15:11,893 --> 00:15:13,727
and she said
she never had better.

207
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,629
Told Thoros she's keeping me
as a payment

208
00:15:15,663 --> 00:15:17,131
for all the free meals
she's given him.

209
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:19,333
Anyway, it's not me
the Brotherhood wants.

210
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,802
My brother ain't no king.

211
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,470
I'm not a Stark
of Winterhell.

212
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,905
Winterfell.

213
00:15:25,907 --> 00:15:28,408
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

214
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:33,580
Well, I made you
something.

215
00:15:38,386 --> 00:15:39,887
What is it?

216
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:42,156
It's a wolf.

217
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,228
Yes, it is.

218
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,864
That's the tail?

219
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:52,399
Yeah.

220
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:56,770
Well, be safe.

221
00:15:56,804 --> 00:15:58,639
Yeah, you, too.

222
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:00,374
Don't get stabbed.

223
00:16:00,408 --> 00:16:03,310
You don't...

224
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:05,179
burn your fingers.

225
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,658
Good-bye, Hot Pie.

226
00:16:17,692 --> 00:16:19,960
Good-bye, Arry.

227
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,875
Up you go, little lady.

228
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:42,583
<i>Hey, Hot Pie.</i>

229
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,886
It's really good.

230
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:54,528
A person could
almost be forgiven

231
00:16:54,562 --> 00:16:56,763
for forgetting
we're at war.

232
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:03,603
It often comforts me to think
that even in war's darkest days,

233
00:17:03,637 --> 00:17:05,472
in most places
in the world

234
00:17:05,506 --> 00:17:09,775
absolutely nothing
is happening.

235
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:14,147
I've missed you, Uncle.

236
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:16,149
Father missed you, too,

237
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:18,084
from the day you left.

238
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:20,286
Maybe he never said it
in so many words--

239
00:17:20,321 --> 00:17:21,922
Maybe?

240
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:24,224
Your father
was a stubborn old ox.

241
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,026
I was surprised
when he died.

242
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,829
Didn't think death
had the patience.

243
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,768
I'm glad
you were with him.

244
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,669
I wish to the gods
I had been.

245
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:41,075
Did you make peace
in the end?

246
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,911
After 30 years of fighting,

247
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:46,347
I don't think he remembered
what started it.

248
00:17:46,381 --> 00:17:50,117
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

249
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:52,319
He said it was
an old joke

250
00:17:52,354 --> 00:17:54,855
and it was never funny
to begin with.

251
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,893
I told him people had been
calling me Blackfish

252
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,796
for so long, they don't
remember my real name.

253
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:08,136
Every time he would leave
for the capital

254
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,905
or fight in a campaign,

255
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:13,073
I'd see him off.

256
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:16,209
"Wait for me,
little Cat," he'd say.

257
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:19,412
"Wait for me

258
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:22,916
and I'll come back
to you."

259
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,485
And I would sit
at this window

260
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,255
every day when the sun
came up, waiting.

261
00:18:31,592 --> 00:18:34,427
I wonder

262
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:37,196
how many times
did Bran or Rickon

263
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:39,165
stare across the moors
of Winterfell

264
00:18:39,199 --> 00:18:41,367
waiting for me
to return.

265
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:44,870
<i>I will never</i>
<i>see them again.</i>

266
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,042
You mustn't think it.

267
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:52,377
We don't know the truth.

268
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:55,080
They could be in hiding.

269
00:18:58,118 --> 00:19:00,887
Robb believes
they're alive.

270
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,056
And he must go on
believing.

271
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:05,859
He's got to remain strong
if he's to prevail.

272
00:19:05,893 --> 00:19:09,963
And you must remain
strong for him.

273
00:19:21,275 --> 00:19:22,742
You're Robb Stark's wife.

274
00:19:22,777 --> 00:19:25,245
Hold still.

275
00:19:26,781 --> 00:19:28,515
Is it true
what they say about him?

276
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:32,118
I don't know.
What do they say about him?

277
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:34,421
That he can turn
into a wolf at night.

278
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,157
True.

279
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:39,426
And he eats the flesh
of his enemies.

280
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,428
True.

281
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:46,399
You're a Lannister,
aren't you?

282
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:47,633
Martyn Lannister.

283
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,803
Martyn Lannister.

284
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,104
You've nothing to fear.

285
00:19:52,139 --> 00:19:54,273
My husband
doesn't eat children.

286
00:19:56,009 --> 00:19:58,377
Unless it's a full moon.

287
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:01,213
It's not a full moon
tonight, is it?

288
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:03,015
See?

289
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,285
Nothing to fear.

290
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,806
Always the artists.

291
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:47,664
It's only horses.

292
00:20:47,698 --> 00:20:49,298
No men.

293
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,036
You said
there was dead crows.

294
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,405
There was.

295
00:20:57,475 --> 00:20:59,209
How many men were here?

296
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,445
About 300.

297
00:21:01,479 --> 00:21:03,880
And you know
what those men are now?

298
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:10,954
We're all the same to them--
meat for their army.

299
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:14,891
Do you think
anyone got away?

300
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,426
<i>It's not impossible.</i>

301
00:21:16,461 --> 00:21:18,828
<i>You don't go far</i>
<i>betting against Mormont.</i>

302
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:21,164
But dead or alive,

303
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,333
he took a big gamble
coming north.

304
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:25,434
<i>And he lost.</i>

305
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:27,803
His best fighting men
are dead.

306
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:31,040
And whether he's Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch

307
00:21:31,074 --> 00:21:33,042
or a blue-eyed corpse,

308
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:35,878
he's a long way
from home.

309
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,280
Tormund.

310
00:21:38,348 --> 00:21:40,316
Climb the Wall.

311
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,419
Take Orell
and 20 good men.

312
00:21:43,453 --> 00:21:45,054
And take this one.

313
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,923
He knows Castle Black's
defenses better than any of us.

314
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,359
And if he's useful, good.
If not...

315
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:52,795
throw him off the Wall.

316
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:55,731
See if crows can fly.

317
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:59,068
We're finally going to war,
old friend?

318
00:21:59,102 --> 00:22:00,670
Hide near Castle Black.

319
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,005
When I give the signal,
hit them in the night.

320
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,741
They've got a big old wall
to hide behind,

321
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:07,610
but it only guards
one side.

322
00:22:09,046 --> 00:22:10,813
- We'll meet again.
- Aye.

323
00:22:10,848 --> 00:22:13,015
- If you do your job.
- Ah.

324
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,218
How will we see
your signal?

325
00:22:15,252 --> 00:22:17,954
Send your eagle above
the Wall every night.

326
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:20,757
When it's time, I'm going
to light the biggest fire

327
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:22,993
the North has ever seen.

328
00:22:49,723 --> 00:22:51,824
Ghost?

329
00:23:05,071 --> 00:23:08,773
What have we here?
Frozen crows?

330
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:10,809
We've come a long way.

331
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:15,581
<i>Smaller flock</i>
<i>than you went north with.</i>

332
00:23:15,615 --> 00:23:17,717
We can talk inside.

333
00:23:17,751 --> 00:23:20,853
Oh, can we?

334
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,442
<i>They need some water.</i>

335
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:45,645
<i>Tether it</i>
<i>and I'll be inside.</i>

336
00:24:01,361 --> 00:24:03,428
<i>Keep your eyes</i>
<i>where they belong.</i>

337
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:05,997
They're not for you.

338
00:24:06,031 --> 00:24:08,499
Bet you feed that pig
better than you feed us.

339
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:11,970
Aye, pig's got
value to me.

340
00:24:12,004 --> 00:24:15,873
You should all be kissing
my feet for letting you in.

341
00:24:17,209 --> 00:24:20,045
I'd have turned you all away
if I wasn't a godly man.

342
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:22,413
You are a godly man?

343
00:24:22,447 --> 00:24:25,884
I am.
I got no fear of what's out there.

344
00:24:25,918 --> 00:24:27,919
<i>When the white cold comes,</i>

345
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:32,090
<i>your swords and cloaks</i>
<i>and bloody fires won't help you.</i>

346
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:36,361
The only ones left will be
those who are right with the gods.

347
00:24:36,395 --> 00:24:37,962
The real gods.

348
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:46,237
Go tell her she can
bite down on a rag

349
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:48,940
or she can bite down
on my fist.

350
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:55,447
Women.

351
00:24:55,481 --> 00:24:57,349
That sow right there
gave birth

352
00:24:57,383 --> 00:24:59,684
<i>to a litter of eight.</i>

353
00:24:59,719 --> 00:25:01,853
Barely a grunt.

354
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:06,224
And she's almost as fat
as this one here.

355
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:08,827
Now why don't
you dine on him?

356
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:11,496
Carve off what you need
as you go.

357
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,665
Well, look at him.
He's a walking feast.

358
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:34,151
<i>Here we are.</i>

359
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:36,554
<i>Sharpen these for me,</i>
<i>would ya?</i>

360
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,141
<i>I see the head.</i>
<i>Push.</i>

361
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:58,943
That's it.

362
00:25:58,978 --> 00:26:01,313
<i>You're nearly there.</i>

363
00:26:05,685 --> 00:26:07,719
One more push
should do it.

364
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:20,033
What is it?
What is it?

365
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,000
Keep quiet.

366
00:27:23,232 --> 00:27:26,067
If you can't ride,
we don't stand a chance.

367
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,136
I can ride.

368
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:30,439
You're sure?

369
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:46,221
Ride east.
Follow the rising sun.

370
00:27:46,255 --> 00:27:48,657
<i>Your sister's</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>

371
00:27:48,691 --> 00:27:51,392
I'll make you a Lord
of the Iron Islands for this.

372
00:27:51,427 --> 00:27:52,587
We're not in
the Iron Islands.

373
00:27:52,595 --> 00:27:55,163
- Go.
- Come on.

374
00:27:55,197 --> 00:27:56,798
Come on.
Come on.

375
00:27:56,832 --> 00:27:58,766
Come on. Come on.

376
00:28:02,671 --> 00:28:04,639
<i>Come on back.</i>

377
00:28:08,377 --> 00:28:10,544
<i>You refuse to tell me</i>
<i>where you're going?</i>

378
00:28:10,612 --> 00:28:13,680
<i>I don't know yet.</i>
<i>The fires will show me.</i>

379
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:16,449
- How long will you be gone?
- I don't know.

380
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:19,152
You're abandoning me.

381
00:28:19,186 --> 00:28:21,354
I will never abandon you.

382
00:28:23,157 --> 00:28:25,325
You are the Son of Fire.

383
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:27,894
- I am sworn to serve you.
- Then serve me.

384
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:30,096
When I return,
you will understand.

385
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,701
My enemies think
they've destroyed me.

386
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:38,772
They're laughing at me

387
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:42,309
the way Renly
laughed at me.

388
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,911
I want Joffrey dead.

389
00:28:44,946 --> 00:28:47,448
I want Robb Stark dead.

390
00:28:50,986 --> 00:28:53,053
Make me another son.

391
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:54,688
I cannot.

392
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:55,923
Why?

393
00:28:55,957 --> 00:28:58,993
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

394
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:01,896
I'm not so easily killed.
Men have been trying for years.

395
00:29:06,702 --> 00:29:09,070
I want you.

396
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,656
Your fires burn low,
my king.

397
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:32,596
There is another way.
A better way.

398
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,198
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

399
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:36,833
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

400
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:38,434
You are.

401
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:40,703
But there are others
with your blood in their veins.

402
00:29:43,374 --> 00:29:45,909
You will sit
on the Iron Throne,

403
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:48,078
but first there must
be sacrifices.

404
00:29:48,112 --> 00:29:50,914
The Lord of Light
demands it.

405
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,861
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

406
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:07,997
- To whom?
- To any slave who contemplates doing

407
00:30:08,031 --> 00:30:10,699
whatever these slaves did.

408
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:13,235
Give me your water.

409
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,972
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

410
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,247
Here, drink.

411
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,818
<i>Leave this place, Your Grace.</i>

412
00:30:29,853 --> 00:30:31,420
Leave tonight,
I beg you.

413
00:30:31,488 --> 00:30:32,955
And what is she
to do for soldiers?

414
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,458
<i>We can find sellswords</i>
<i>in Pentos and Myr.</i>

415
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:39,962
Is it "we" already,
Ser Barristan?

416
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:43,799
If you want to sit on the throne your
ancestors built, you must win it.

417
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:46,035
That will mean blood on your
hands before the thing is done.

418
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:49,271
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

419
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:54,810
How many wars have you
fought in, Ser Barristan?

420
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:57,078
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

421
00:30:57,113 --> 00:30:59,481
where innocents didn't die
by the thousands?

422
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:07,189
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, khaleesi.

423
00:31:07,223 --> 00:31:10,358
You know what I saw?
Butchery.

424
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:12,761
Babies, children,
old men.

425
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,197
More women raped
than you can count.

426
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:16,831
There's a beast
in every man

427
00:31:16,866 --> 00:31:19,835
and it stirs when you put
a sword in his hand.

428
00:31:19,902 --> 00:31:22,237
But the Unsullied
are not men.

429
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:23,905
They do not rape.

430
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,009
They do not put cities to the sword
unless they're ordered to do so.

431
00:31:27,043 --> 00:31:31,713
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

432
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:33,214
Do you disagree,
Ser Barristan?

433
00:31:33,249 --> 00:31:36,318
When your brother Rhaegar led
his army into battle at the Trident,

434
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,987
men died for him
because they believed in him,

435
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:40,722
because they loved him,

436
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:43,225
not because they'd been bought
at a slaver's auction.

437
00:31:45,161 --> 00:31:47,796
I fought beside the last dragon
on that day, Your Grace.

438
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,634
I bled beside him.

439
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:55,204
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

440
00:31:55,238 --> 00:31:57,073
and Rhaegar died.

441
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:00,644
Did you know him well,
Ser Barristan?

442
00:32:00,678 --> 00:32:05,215
I did, Your Grace.
Finest man I ever met.

443
00:32:05,283 --> 00:32:07,451
I wish I had known him.

444
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:09,519
But he was not
the last dragon.

445
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:21,511
All?

446
00:32:21,536 --> 00:32:24,132
Did this one's ears
mishear, Your Grace?

447
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,905
They did not.
I want to buy them all.

448
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,190
There are 8,000 Unsullied
in Astapor.

449
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:46,958
Is this what you mean
by all?

450
00:32:46,992 --> 00:32:48,893
Yes. 8,000.

451
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:51,229
<i>And the ones</i>
<i>still in training as well.</i>

452
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,009
Master Greizhen says they
cannot sell half-trained boys.

453
00:33:04,043 --> 00:33:06,344
<i>If they fail</i>
<i>on the battlefield,</i>

454
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:08,613
they will bring shame
upon all of Astapor.

455
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:10,515
I will have them all
or take none.

456
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:11,740
Many will fall in battle.

457
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:13,817
I'll need the boys to pick
up the swords they drop.

458
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:22,126
Master Kraznys says
you cannot afford this.

459
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:28,800
Your ship will buy you 100 Unsullied.

460
00:33:31,103 --> 00:33:33,672
Because Master Kraznys is generous.

461
00:33:33,706 --> 00:33:38,110
<i>The gold you have left is worth 10.</i>

462
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:41,913
But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.

463
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,484
The Dothraki you have with you--

464
00:33:50,823 --> 00:33:54,626
The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed,

465
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,195
<i>but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied</i>

466
00:33:57,229 --> 00:33:58,797
<i>for all of them.</i>

467
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:02,934
Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay

468
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:08,574
for the remaining 7,877 Unsullied.

469
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:16,515
I have dragons.
I'll give you one.

470
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,289
You will win the throne
with dragons, not slaves, Your Grace.

471
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:26,024
Khaleesi, please.

472
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:36,668
Three dragons.

473
00:34:36,703 --> 00:34:37,970
- One.
- Two.

474
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:39,338
One.

475
00:34:49,848 --> 00:34:52,083
<i>They want the biggest one.</i>

476
00:34:52,117 --> 00:34:54,552
- Done.
- Done.

477
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:01,926
I'll take you
as well, now.

478
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:04,896
You'll be Master
Kraznys' gift to me.

479
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,065
A token of a bargain
well struck.

480
00:35:17,776 --> 00:35:20,911
Khaleesi, a dragon is worth
more than any army.

481
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:23,214
Aegon Targaryen
proved that.

482
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:26,817
You're both here
to advise me.

483
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:28,838
I value your advice,
but if you ever question me

484
00:35:28,863 --> 00:35:30,388
in front of strangers again,

485
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,923
you'll be advising
someone else.

486
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:35,259
Is that understood?

487
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:39,730
<i>Do you have a name?</i>

488
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:42,399
This one's name
is Missandei, Your Grace.

489
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:44,635
Do you have a family?
A mother and a father

490
00:35:44,669 --> 00:35:46,670
you'd return to
if you had the choice?

491
00:35:46,705 --> 00:35:50,007
No, Your Grace.
No family living.

492
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:53,177
You belong to me now.
It is your duty to tell me the truth.

493
00:35:53,211 --> 00:35:55,779
Yes, Your Grace.
Lying is a great offense.

494
00:35:55,814 --> 00:35:59,183
Many of those on the Walk of Punishment
were taken there for less.

495
00:35:59,217 --> 00:36:01,938
I offered water to one of the slaves
dying on the Walk of Punishment.

496
00:36:01,953 --> 00:36:05,222
Do you know what he said to me?
"Let me die."

497
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:08,125
There are no masters
in the grave, Your Grace.

498
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:10,794
Is it true what
Master Kraznys told me

499
00:36:10,829 --> 00:36:13,964
about the Unsullied?
About their obedience?

500
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:16,533
All questions have been
taken from them.

501
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:18,434
They obey, that is all.

502
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:21,237
<i>Once they are yours,</i>
<i>they are yours.</i>

503
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:23,338
They will fall on their swords
if you command it.

504
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:26,842
And what about you?
You know that I'm taking you to war.

505
00:36:26,876 --> 00:36:31,012
<i>You may go hungry.</i>
<i>You may fall sick.</i>

506
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:33,181
You may be killed.

507
00:36:33,216 --> 00:36:34,917
<i>Valar morghulis.</i>

508
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:38,520
Yes, all men
must die.

509
00:36:39,556 --> 00:36:41,690
But we are not men.

510
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:55,170
<i>A surprising place to keep</i>
<i>the royal ledgers.</i>

511
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:57,306
<i>I'm surprised you're surprised.</i>

512
00:36:58,942 --> 00:37:02,344
This is the safest place
in the city.

513
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:04,280
Not for bastards.

514
00:37:04,314 --> 00:37:06,616
That's all of them,
my lord.

515
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:09,753
<i>Thank you, my dear.</i>
<i>Pod.</i>

516
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:12,956
Pod.
Take them outside.

517
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,692
- I'll be there in a moment.
- Yes, my lord.

518
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,740
I hear you owe that boy
a significant debt.

519
00:37:29,774 --> 00:37:31,575
Only my life.

520
00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:33,543
Not all that significant,
I'm afraid.

521
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:35,612
You should
have him knighted.

522
00:37:35,646 --> 00:37:38,815
If only the Master of Coin
had such power.

523
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:41,918
If only.

524
00:37:43,854 --> 00:37:46,056
I owe you
a significant debt.

525
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,458
Our redheaded friend.

526
00:37:48,492 --> 00:37:51,260
You secured her release
when the queen detained her.

527
00:37:51,294 --> 00:37:53,262
Oh, that.

528
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:56,465
Of course.
A simple misunderstanding.

529
00:37:56,499 --> 00:37:58,267
Apparently,
Her Grace believed

530
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:02,338
that you two had some sort
of special relationship.

531
00:38:02,406 --> 00:38:05,308
We don't.
I did fuck her once.

532
00:38:05,342 --> 00:38:07,376
- I know.
- But we don't.

533
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,045
I know.

534
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,780
But how would the queen
get that idea?

535
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:13,583
Why don't you ask her?

536
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:19,055
Any advice for me
on my new position?

537
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,025
Keep a low profile.

538
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:25,328
If I had a gold dragon

539
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:28,431
for every time I heard
that joke, I'd be richer than you are.

540
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:30,333
Well, you are
richer than I am.

541
00:38:30,368 --> 00:38:32,402
Good point.

542
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:35,772
They're only numbers.
Numbers on paper.

543
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:39,276
Once you understand that,
it's easy to make them behave.

544
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,845
Trivial even.

545
00:38:40,879 --> 00:38:42,647
You want a real challenge?

546
00:38:42,681 --> 00:38:44,082
Try whores.

547
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:46,685
I've tried quite a few.

548
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:49,187
Well, lots of work to do.

549
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:51,957
Enjoy the Eyrie.

550
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:53,992
Come on,
I'm here later.

551
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:55,861
Come on.

552
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:00,933
Tonight, then.

553
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:04,970
Looks like dull reading.

554
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:07,272
You think all reading
is dull reading.

555
00:39:07,306 --> 00:39:10,175
It's an opinion I share with
some of the finest men I know.

556
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:12,809
The secret history of the Seven
Kingdoms is written in these pages.

557
00:39:12,812 --> 00:39:15,448
Unless Lord Twatbeard
made up a bunch of numbers

558
00:39:15,482 --> 00:39:17,049
to hide what
he's really up to.

559
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:19,118
Unless he made it
all up, yes.

560
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:21,554
- Podrick, do keep up.
- Yes, my lord.

561
00:39:21,588 --> 00:39:23,856
- Podrick.
- Yes, my lord?

562
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:27,260
After a long consultation
with my colleague Ser Bronn,

563
00:39:27,294 --> 00:39:29,195
I finally found
a suitable reward

564
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,531
for the services you've
provided over and above

565
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:33,133
<i>what might be</i>
<i>considered reasonable.</i>

566
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,569
Tell me, Pod,

567
00:39:35,603 --> 00:39:38,372
have you ever been
with a woman?

568
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,941
- No, my lord.
- Wonderful.

569
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:46,380
Genna specializes
in first-timers.

570
00:39:46,414 --> 00:39:49,149
She's not bad with
second-timers, either.

571
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:51,151
Uh, my lord...

572
00:39:51,186 --> 00:39:53,621
A fair enough repayment
for putting your spear

573
00:39:53,655 --> 00:39:55,856
through my would-be killer's face,
wouldn't you say?

574
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,762
Now, as it happens,

575
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:03,298
Marei...

576
00:40:03,332 --> 00:40:06,601
is quite the spear
handler herself.

577
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:10,172
She's here to thank you
for staying by my side

578
00:40:10,206 --> 00:40:12,942
as the battle raged
all around me.

579
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:14,811
He's handsome.

580
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:18,148
You didn't tell me
he was handsome.

581
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:23,087
Kayla is famous
from here to Volantis

582
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:25,356
in certain circles.

583
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:27,992
<i>One of four women</i>
<i>in the world</i>

584
00:40:28,027 --> 00:40:31,763
who can perform a proper
Meereenese Knot.

585
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:34,866
My lord, I don't even...

586
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:36,635
<i>She's here to thank you</i>

587
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:39,404
<i>for being a thoroughly</i>
<i>respectful fellow</i>

588
00:40:39,439 --> 00:40:42,241
who's never once failed
to address me as "my lord."

589
00:40:45,578 --> 00:40:47,446
Be back in time
for my supper.

590
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,652
Pace yourself, lad.

591
00:40:54,687 --> 00:40:57,121
For years I've heard
that Littlefinger

592
00:40:57,156 --> 00:40:59,524
is a magician.

593
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,527
Whenever the crown needs money,
he rubs his hands together

594
00:41:02,561 --> 00:41:05,196
and, poof,
mountains of gold.

595
00:41:05,231 --> 00:41:07,632
Let me guess.
He's not a magician.

596
00:41:07,667 --> 00:41:09,601
No.

597
00:41:11,104 --> 00:41:14,039
- He's stealing it?
- Worse, he's borrowing it.

598
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:16,675
What's wrong with that?

599
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:20,378
We can't afford to pay it back,
that's what's wrong with it.

600
00:41:20,413 --> 00:41:22,747
The crown owes millions
to my father.

601
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:25,116
Seeing as it's his grandson's
ass on the throne,

602
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,118
I imagine he'll forgive
that debt.

603
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:29,453
Forgive a debt, my father?

604
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,922
For a man of the world,
you're strangely naive.

605
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,891
I've never borrowed
money before.

606
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:36,293
I'm not clear on the rules.

607
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:37,762
Well...

608
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:39,997
<i>Ahem!</i>

609
00:41:42,034 --> 00:41:44,335
The basic principle is

610
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,870
I lend you money,

611
00:41:45,905 --> 00:41:48,440
and after an agreed upon
period of time,

612
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:51,076
you return it
with interest.

613
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,577
And what if I don't?

614
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:54,679
Well, you have to.

615
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:56,046
But what if I don't?

616
00:41:56,081 --> 00:41:58,415
This is why
I don't lend you money.

617
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,952
Anyway, it's not my father
I'm worried about.

618
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,954
It's the Iron Bank
of Braavos.

619
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,689
We owe them
tens of millions.

620
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:10,226
If we fail to repay these loans,
the bank will fund our enemies.

621
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,396
One way or another,
they always get their gold back.

622
00:42:15,066 --> 00:42:17,968
Ah, the return
of the conquering hero.

623
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:20,471
Does he have a little
jaunt in his step?

624
00:42:20,505 --> 00:42:22,139
The lad's
practically skipping.

625
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,841
You were gone
a long time.

626
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,676
I trust you got
your money's worth.

627
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:27,344
Or should I say
my money's worth?

628
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,115
Oh, it was a gift,
Podrick.

629
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,884
This is more than
I give you in a year.

630
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,887
He's a squire.
You don't pay him.

631
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,422
Oh, then it's much more
than I give you in a year.

632
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,357
They wouldn't
take it, my lord.

633
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:44,860
Maybe they're trying
to curry some favor

634
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,262
<i>with the new</i>
<i>Master of Coin.</i>

635
00:42:46,296 --> 00:42:48,397
Have you ever known a whore
to turn down gold?

636
00:42:48,431 --> 00:42:50,966
They were happy enough
to take it when I gave it to them.

637
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,701
What did you tell them?

638
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:54,302
I didn't tell them
anything.

639
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:57,406
- What did you do to them?
- Lots of things.

640
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,374
And they seemed
to like these things?

641
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:00,943
Yes, my lord.

642
00:43:00,977 --> 00:43:02,678
<i>Of course</i>
<i>they seemed to like it.</i>

643
00:43:02,712 --> 00:43:04,213
They're paid
to seem to like it.

644
00:43:04,247 --> 00:43:06,482
Only they weren't paid.

645
00:43:06,516 --> 00:43:09,452
What are you saying?
These ladies enjoyed him so much,

646
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,087
they gave him
the time for free?

647
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,489
Is that what
you're telling us?

648
00:43:18,061 --> 00:43:19,328
Sit down, Podrick.

649
00:43:25,268 --> 00:43:28,369
We're going
to need details.

650
00:43:28,404 --> 00:43:30,806
Copious details.

651
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,082
Come on!
Come on!

652
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:17,586
Come on!

653
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,655
Come on.

654
00:44:55,224 --> 00:44:57,659
Ha! Ha!

655
00:45:45,711 --> 00:45:48,146
You know how we deal
with runaways here, do you?

656
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:57,056
Take off his pants.

657
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:59,493
No! No!

658
00:45:59,527 --> 00:46:01,161
No, no, no!

659
00:46:01,196 --> 00:46:03,296
I'm gonna fuck you
into the dirt.

660
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,832
No, please!
No, no, no!

661
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:07,433
No, don't!

662
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:11,737
<i>No, please!</i>

663
00:46:11,772 --> 00:46:14,373
<i>No! No!</i>

664
00:46:43,504 --> 00:46:45,873
You little bastard.

665
00:46:55,716 --> 00:46:57,751
Come, my lord.

666
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:03,757
You're a long way from home
and winter is coming.

667
00:47:29,482 --> 00:47:31,884
I'll take
the big bitch first.

668
00:47:31,918 --> 00:47:35,287
When she's good and wet,
you lot can finish her off.

669
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:37,789
<i>My lord, I am</i>
<i>Brienne of Tarth.</i>

670
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:40,158
Lady Catelyn Stark
commanded me

671
00:47:40,192 --> 00:47:42,861
to deliver Ser Jaime
to King's Landing.

672
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:44,829
Catelyn Stark's
a treasonous cunt.

673
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,831
<i>Orders were to take</i>
<i>the Kingslayer alive.</i>

674
00:47:46,865 --> 00:47:49,033
Nobody said shit about you.

675
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,140
You're only
making it worse.

676
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:02,914
<i>Take her over there</i>
<i>where it's dark.</i>

677
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:04,349
I'd like a little privacy.

678
00:48:05,451 --> 00:48:08,386
Come on!

679
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:21,233
You know who she is,
don't you?

680
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:27,173
A big dumb bitch
from who cares where.

681
00:48:29,743 --> 00:48:31,310
Never been with
a woman that big.

682
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:34,113
<i>She's Brienne of Tarth.</i>

683
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:36,850
Her father
is Lord Selwyn Tarth.

684
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:38,485
Heard of Tarth?

685
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:41,354
<i>I'm gonna cut your throat!</i>

686
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:44,390
They call it the Sapphire Isle.
Do you know why?

687
00:48:44,425 --> 00:48:47,427
Every sapphire
in Westeros

688
00:48:47,461 --> 00:48:48,995
was mined on Tarth.

689
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:52,499
<i>Sapphires are gemstones.</i>

690
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:55,835
- <i>The blue ones.</i>
- I know what they are.

691
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,606
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

692
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:02,342
in sapphires
if she's returned to him.

693
00:49:02,376 --> 00:49:05,612
<i>But only if she's alive,</i>

694
00:49:05,646 --> 00:49:08,548
her honor unbesmirched.

695
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,993
Bring her back here.

696
00:49:21,061 --> 00:49:22,428
<i>Yes, my lord.</i>

697
00:49:22,462 --> 00:49:24,964
- <i>Get up.</i>
<i>- Come on.</i>

698
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:27,634
<i>Come on, on your feet.</i>

699
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:31,070
<i>Unbesmirched.</i>

700
00:49:32,572 --> 00:49:34,807
Not defiled.

701
00:49:34,841 --> 00:49:37,609
Fancy word
for a fancy man.

702
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:41,346
I hated to read
as a child,

703
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:44,182
<i>but my father forced me</i>
<i>to study the books every morning</i>

704
00:49:44,216 --> 00:49:47,386
<i>before I could practice</i>
<i>with sword or horse.</i>

705
00:49:47,453 --> 00:49:50,789
Two hours every day holed up in
the maester's chambers.

706
00:49:50,823 --> 00:49:54,259
I learned a lot
of fancy words.

707
00:49:54,293 --> 00:49:56,495
I bet you did.

708
00:50:04,638 --> 00:50:06,672
Your father,

709
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:09,575
he'd pay your weight
in gold to get you back?

710
00:50:11,077 --> 00:50:14,013
You'll be a rich man
till the end of your days.

711
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:15,915
<i>And your sons</i>
<i>will be rich men</i>

712
00:50:15,949 --> 00:50:18,283
<i>and their sons</i>
<i>after them.</i>

713
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:20,620
Lands, titles--

714
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:22,922
you'll have them all.

715
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:27,727
The North
can't win this war.

716
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:30,329
You're a smart man.
You understand that.

717
00:50:30,364 --> 00:50:32,064
We have the numbers.
We have the gold.

718
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:34,167
Aye, you have both.

719
00:50:35,702 --> 00:50:38,638
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause

720
00:50:38,672 --> 00:50:40,507
is admirable.

721
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:43,210
Fighting for
a winning cause

722
00:50:43,244 --> 00:50:45,745
is far more rewarding.

723
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,181
Hard to argue with that.

724
00:50:51,453 --> 00:50:54,422
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

725
00:50:54,456 --> 00:50:58,660
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree.

726
00:50:58,694 --> 00:51:01,096
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

727
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:04,933
but if I could sleep
lying down,

728
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:06,769
my back would
thank you for it.

729
00:51:06,803 --> 00:51:08,838
I'm not as young

730
00:51:08,872 --> 00:51:11,540
and resilient
as I was once.

731
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:13,576
None of us are.

732
00:51:15,879 --> 00:51:18,081
<i>Unchain Ser Jaime</i>
<i>from the tree.</i>

733
00:51:18,115 --> 00:51:20,550
<i>Come on, men.</i>

734
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:29,292
Suppose you'll be wanting
something to eat.

735
00:51:29,327 --> 00:51:31,194
I'm famished, actually.

736
00:51:31,229 --> 00:51:34,331
<i>I think we've got a spare</i>
<i>partridge on the fire.</i>

737
00:51:34,366 --> 00:51:37,168
Well, I do like partridge.

738
00:51:42,608 --> 00:51:46,578
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

739
00:51:50,082 --> 00:51:52,517
Will this work
as a table, my lord?

740
00:51:52,552 --> 00:51:54,419
Oh, yes.
Yes, this will do nic--

741
00:51:54,454 --> 00:51:56,555
ah!

742
00:51:56,589 --> 00:51:58,757
On the stump.

743
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,066
You think you're
the smartest man there is.

744
00:52:09,802 --> 00:52:13,170
That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape

745
00:52:13,205 --> 00:52:15,306
and lick your boots.

746
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,841
- My father--
- And if you get in any trouble,

747
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:20,744
all you've got to do
is say "my father"

748
00:52:20,778 --> 00:52:23,813
and that's it,
all your troubles are gone.

749
00:52:25,415 --> 00:52:28,318
- Don't.
- Have you got something to say?

750
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:35,624
Careful. You don't want to say
the wrong thing.

751
00:52:38,962 --> 00:52:41,664
You're nothing
without your daddy,

752
00:52:41,698 --> 00:52:45,134
and your daddy
ain't here.

753
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:47,603
Never forget that.

754
00:52:49,173 --> 00:52:51,341
Here, this should
help you remember.

754
