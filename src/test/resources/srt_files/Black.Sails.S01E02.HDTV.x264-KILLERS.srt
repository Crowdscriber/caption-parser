00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,186
GATES: Singleton, he has the votes
to remove you as captain.

3
00:00:09,252 --> 00:00:11,588
They think he has any idea how
to put money in their pockets?

4
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,196
Landfall. We're home.

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,797
- SILVER: Is this English soil?
- LOGAN: It was once.

6
00:00:15,862 --> 00:00:17,766
- Whose is it?
- Ours. (Laughs)

7
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,607
You screwed me tonight.
Flint, his captaincy, I had an interest.

8
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:23,373
When the sea grows rough,
you come to Max.

9
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:28,046
L'Urca de Lima.
Total cargo of $5 million.

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,415
Take them into custody.

11
00:00:31,417 --> 00:00:33,048
What happened with Richard?

12
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:36,485
Someone tore from this log
the very page necessary

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,220
to discover that prize
and then stoked your resentment

14
00:00:39,285 --> 00:00:41,389
to make himself your captain.

15
00:00:44,095 --> 00:00:45,759
It's the stolen page.

16
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:47,168
MAX: A whore for every
finger on your hand,

17
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:49,033
but your eyes keep drifting to this.

18
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:51,902
I think I have something
you might like to buy.

(Chatter)

23
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,931
When my father still lived here,
this place was a fucking mess.

24
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:15,171
Men just fucked in tents,

25
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,967
threw their shit in the streets.

26
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:20,533
I wonder if he didn't notice
everyone living like animals

27
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:22,004
or if he just didn't care.

28
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,002
Why all this talk of your father?

29
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:27,936
A man-o'-war was spotted yesterday.

30
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,971
Royal Navy.

31
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:36,908
What if today's the day?

32
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,147
What if Scott
is downstairs right now

33
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:40,811
waiting to give me the news?

34
00:03:40,884 --> 00:03:44,849
The British are back.
Decamp from Nassau.

35
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:46,618
And then what?

36
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:51,153
Then they blockade the island,
choke off trade.

37
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:53,023
A few crews will resist,

38
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:55,990
but how long can they survive
without my father's support?

39
00:03:56,055 --> 00:03:58,359
One by one their numbers
will dwindle.

40
00:03:58,432 --> 00:03:59,927
The fort will be abandoned.

41
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,925
Soldiers will storm the beach.

42
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:06,697
By the time the smoke clears,
my father will have arrived.

43
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:09,865
First time he's set foot
here in five years

44
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:12,735
waving the royal commission
that his bribes purchased

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,271
and lording over the place.

46
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:16,467
Round of applause,

47
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:18,666
the new governor.

48
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:22,601
Somewhere in London, some foul
fuck will get news of all of this,

49
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:24,506
light his pipe and say,

50
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:28,776
"Finally, all is right again
in Nassau."

51
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:32,613
You say this as if it is certain.

52
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,811
Perhaps you can buy this place.

53
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,914
Nassau will need an inn.

54
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,913
Max could be your partner.

55
00:04:40,986 --> 00:04:43,153
There is no finer host in the world.

56
00:04:43,218 --> 00:04:46,186
How will Mr. Noonan feel
when he hears of this plan?

57
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,919
I think maybe soon
what Mr. Noonan feels

58
00:04:48,992 --> 00:04:51,359
will be of no concern to me.

59
00:04:53,824 --> 00:04:55,726
- (Knocking)
- Yes?

60
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:59,460
It's Scott. Can you let Mistress Guthrie
know she's needed?

61
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,733
I'll be down in a minute.

62
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:07,510
I think, perhaps, you may be
a little longer than that.

63
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:11,881
<i>Viens ici.</i>

64
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:21,322

65
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:23,889
- (Dog barking)
- (Man shouting)

66
00:05:23,962 --> 00:05:26,497
- (Men laughing)
- (Chicken clucking)

67
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,567
Where is he?

68
00:05:38,637 --> 00:05:41,203
Says he wants to be the first
one Flint sees when it's done.

69
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,337
Prize master's in the tent.

70
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:06,159
(Men cheering)

71
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,465
MAN:
Show us the color of the gold!

72
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,801
(Men shouting)

73
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:14,137
Rum and snatch for each and all.

74
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:17,840
- (Cheering)
- Gentlemen, I understand your excitement,

75
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,069
but do we really think
it is a good idea

76
00:06:20,142 --> 00:06:23,277
to open up what are,
to be fair, depleted reserves

77
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,846
and start spending money
we haven't earned yet?

78
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,708
- MAN: Money we haven't earned yet?
- DUFRESNE: Gentlemen.

79
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:30,409
(Men cheering)

80
00:06:30,482 --> 00:06:31,880
MAN:
Gold for the whores!

81
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:34,214
(Laughing)

82
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:36,180
GATES:
Billy.

83
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:39,777
Billy. Billy.

84
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,794
Jesus.

85
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:54,790
What did I do?

86
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:07,088
MAN:
Have some whores!

87
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,990
(Men cheering)

88
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,590
MAN:
Drinks and whores!

89
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:14,165
We don't like thieves.

90
00:07:15,863 --> 00:07:18,033
Beg pardon?

91
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:20,304
You shouldn't steal.

92
00:07:23,306 --> 00:07:25,440
That's what happens.

93
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:31,278
I see that.

94
00:07:36,453 --> 00:07:38,683
I'm hungry.

95
00:07:40,156 --> 00:07:43,922
All right. I'll see what I can do.

96
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,058
You mustn't steal.

97
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,794
He wasn't no thief, Randall.

98
00:07:51,867 --> 00:07:53,866
(Laughing)

99
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,201
Here.

100
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:58,273
Not now.

101
00:07:58,338 --> 00:08:00,410
Don't be stupid.

102
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:08,008
The schedule is here on the island.

103
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:09,343
How do you know?

104
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:13,783
Whoever stole it
came back to read the log,

105
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:16,425
find out exactly
what it was they had.

106
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,688
Someone on that deck
out there is our thief.

107
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:21,525
Well, it can't be one of our men.

108
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,219
How would they have
known to look for it?

109
00:08:23,292 --> 00:08:26,596
And the men taken from the
prize were all searched.

110
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:29,994
What?

111
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,033
The cook.
I found him hiding in the armory

112
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:33,529
standing over a dead body.

113
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:35,265
Said it was suicide.

114
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,170
Did you search him?

115
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:42,943
SILVER:
Hold that boat.

116
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:45,269
- There will be another.
- I'm sure you're right, but...

117
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:48,307
I understand everyone
wants to get laid,

118
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:50,610
but we disembark by seniority.

119
00:08:50,675 --> 00:08:52,577
Perhaps if you made
the men some food,

120
00:08:52,642 --> 00:08:56,178
it would take the edge off the
spree they're about to go on.

121
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,956
Careful.

122
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:12,155
Unless you want everybody
to know what he's got.

123
00:09:37,316 --> 00:09:39,114
Where the fuck is he going?

124
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:42,621
Ah!

125
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:45,460
CREW:
Ooh!

126
00:09:45,525 --> 00:09:47,858
(Screams)

127
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,359
(Laughing)

128
00:09:49,425 --> 00:09:52,327
That kid must really
want to get laid.

129
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,125
(Laughs)

130
00:09:57,595 --> 00:09:59,993
Come on, give us your hand.

131
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,935
(Bird squawking)

132
00:10:13,773 --> 00:10:15,973
I know it's late.

133
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,853
(Coins clink)

134
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,549
For Max.

135
00:10:25,622 --> 00:10:27,052
What happened to you?

136
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:29,156
She worked late
with the Ranger crew.

137
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:31,990
Noonan know about this?
He's just gonna let it go?

138
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,830
50 pieces they paid her.

139
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:36,533
That's worth a few nicks
to the hull, wouldn't you say?

140
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:38,667
I have news.

141
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,700
Please tell me it's the good kind.

142
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,900
A crew of 10 have just
arrived out of Carolina.

143
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:45,668
Captain's waiting for us
at the warehouse.

144
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:47,506
He bring a prize with him?

145
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:51,175
50 barrels of tobacco and a
fluyt's worth of rare silks.

146
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,672
Let's go say hello.

147
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:56,342
I had hoped we'd have a word first

148
00:10:56,407 --> 00:10:58,342
before we start work.

149
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:06,952
You walked away from me last night

150
00:11:07,025 --> 00:11:09,287
and did something very foolish

151
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,323
to a man whose temper you can
no longer afford to provoke.

152
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,625
He moved on Flint.
I responded.

153
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,055
And what did that accomplish?

154
00:11:17,128 --> 00:11:19,390
It made me feel better.

155
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:22,059
Eleanor,

156
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:24,430
you can never forget
who these men are.

157
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:26,564
They are not our friends.

158
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,363
They are not our subjects.

159
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:30,098
They want your father's business.

160
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:33,201
That is the only reason we do not
find their knives at our throats.

161
00:11:35,137 --> 00:11:36,936
Tell me you understand.

162
00:11:39,072 --> 00:11:42,311
Be honest, is it bad?

163
00:12:02,746 --> 00:12:05,685
5,000 pesos in pearls.

164
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,391
Don't leave much in the reserves.

165
00:12:10,456 --> 00:12:13,557
An investment, if you'll allow.

166
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:17,525
Good morning, Captain.

167
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,596
What are you up to, Jack?

168
00:12:20,661 --> 00:12:22,099
There's been a development.

169
00:12:22,164 --> 00:12:24,465
It seems that Captain Flint
has for weeks

170
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,526
been chasing a piece of information
that would enable the bearer

171
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:30,631
to know the precise whereabouts
of the Spanish treasure galleon

172
00:12:30,704 --> 00:12:32,935
Urca de Lima.

173
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,667
And you know this how?

174
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,337
Because the thief
who stole it from him

175
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:41,337
has offered to sell it to me.

176
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,178
- You've met this person?
- His agent.

177
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:44,978
The thief's too smart
to show us his face.

178
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:49,146
He's asking 5,000 pesos
for a chance at five million.

179
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:53,647
I'm sorry,
have I said something funny?

180
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,213
You'd empty our reserves
to purchase what?

181
00:12:56,286 --> 00:12:58,715
A scrap of paper someone told
you may be worth something?

182
00:12:58,788 --> 00:12:59,850
They have no reason to lie to me.

183
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,448
They have 5,000 reasons
to lie to you.

184
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:05,750
Please tell me
I don't need to explain further.

185
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:07,957
Well, I doubt the crew
will share your sentiments

186
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,821
with what they stand to gain.

187
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:12,659
Unless you have a score
of your own to present.

188
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:16,829
Or are we to sit here patiently waiting
for Eleanor Guthrie to arrive,

189
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,698
place one at our feet?

190
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:22,005
Remind me how many leads
have the Guthries brought us

191
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,037
since you two had your falling out?

192
00:13:26,476 --> 00:13:29,335
Please tell me I don't
have to explain further.

193
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,590
Find me when Singleton's
back and it's done.

194
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,197
The fuck's his problem?

195
00:13:50,262 --> 00:13:51,702
He thought that Flint
was the only one

196
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:54,904
standing in the way
of his being crowned king.

197
00:13:54,969 --> 00:13:57,008
He thought wrong.

198
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,590
Hey, friend, can you point
me to the blacksmith?

199
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:25,494
- Which way to the butcher?
- In the square.

200
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,526
I need a new shirt.

201
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:38,768
Hey, anybody know
where the cook went?

202
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,870
- That way.
- That way.

203
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:43,868
Oh, Jesus.

204
00:14:43,933 --> 00:14:45,940
What do we do?

205
00:14:46,005 --> 00:14:48,772
Don't get too comfortable
in there, you twats.

206
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:51,276
A couple of fucks
and you're back on this beach.

207
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:54,116
We got a score to chase.

208
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:57,914
(Rhythmic slapping)

209
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:00,712
I want to fuck, Max.

210
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:04,887
- Max.
- Yes?

211
00:15:04,952 --> 00:15:08,516
- I want to fuck.
- You know the rules.

212
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,156
That bitch keeps you all to herself.

213
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,060
And she pays for the privilege.

214
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:15,723
It's not fair.

215
00:15:15,796 --> 00:15:17,762
(Breathing heavily)

216
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,795
It's not... it's not f...

217
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,435
it's... it's not fair.

218
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,602
It's not...

219
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:25,337
- What are you doing?
- Apologies.

220
00:15:25,403 --> 00:15:27,336
Don't let me interrupt.

221
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,903
Wait your fucking turn!

222
00:15:28,968 --> 00:15:31,403
Certainly.

223
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,079
BOTH:
Outside!

224
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,077
Okay.

225
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:42,011
Okay, this is going to require
a bit of an explanation.

226
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:43,516
Fuck.

227
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,750
Come back later, mon cher.

228
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,685
(Muttering)

229
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,557
Have you no decency?

230
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:00,429
Who do you think you are that
you can cost me this money?

231
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,300
Necessary, I'm afraid.

232
00:16:02,364 --> 00:16:04,299
We have a problem.

233
00:16:04,372 --> 00:16:06,299
- Flint's onto me.
- And so you come here?

234
00:16:06,371 --> 00:16:08,433
- What if you were followed?
- No, I was careful.

235
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,537
Careful? You just told
me you've been caught.

236
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,041
Well, that's true.

237
00:16:12,106 --> 00:16:14,838
You fucked me.

238
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:16,541
There's no need to panic.

239
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,045
We can still make the deal and...

240
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,646
And then what?

241
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,281
How long before Flint discovers
I had a part in this?

242
00:16:22,354 --> 00:16:23,754
When a man is being fucked,

243
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,089
he wants to know
whose cock was in him.

244
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:28,190
True, but by that time,

245
00:16:28,255 --> 00:16:31,188
these two cocks will be in a
boat halfway to Port Royal.

246
00:16:31,253 --> 00:16:33,219
Port Royal?

247
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:36,056
After I get payment,
we meet at the boat

248
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:37,960
in the cove and leave tonight.

249
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:43,091
Unless there's something
else keeping you here.

250
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,532
MAN: I was told Richard Guthrie
was the fence in Nassau.

251
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:52,237
Brought his ships down from Boston.

252
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,870
Hides his plunder in sugar barrels.

253
00:16:54,943 --> 00:16:57,342
But unless he went
and sprouted tits,

254
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:58,940
you're not him.

255
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:00,908
(Laughs)

256
00:17:00,981 --> 00:17:02,981
I'm his daughter Eleanor.

257
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,850
I run the operation here
alongside my retainer Mr. Scott.

258
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,787
A schoolgirl and a sugar monkey.

259
00:17:10,882 --> 00:17:12,951
We pay in coin, trade, or credit

260
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:15,285
the moment your goods
enter my warehouse.

261
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,959
And while we're off selling it at
rates you couldn't hope to match,

262
00:17:18,024 --> 00:17:21,523
you and your men get to enjoy the many
pleasantries Nassau has to offer.

263
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:23,124
And what will that cost us exactly?

264
00:17:23,197 --> 00:17:27,392
- Around four reales on the dollar.
- Half our profits go to you?

265
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:29,159
At first.

266
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:32,030
But the more you earn,
the better the terms.

267
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:34,937
Oh, you enjoy setting terms, do you?

268
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:37,799
Since I sprouted tits.

269
00:17:37,872 --> 00:17:41,300
Well, Port Royal is not that far.

270
00:17:41,373 --> 00:17:43,838
I think I'll keep
my haul and my profits.

271
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:46,174
- No offense.
- None taken.

272
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,543
Though you might want to keep
that decision to yourself.

273
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:49,675
And why is that?

274
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:51,315
Because the last fool
who turned her down

275
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,082
was never seen or heard from again.

276
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:56,015
Though the same can't
be said for his plunder.

277
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,489
A seller brought it to Mistress Guthrie
the very next day.

278
00:18:00,786 --> 00:18:03,322
And that seller would be you?

279
00:18:03,395 --> 00:18:05,427
Well, perhaps you'll find me
more of a match

280
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:08,128
than that other craven bastard.

281
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:11,927
James Bridge of the Demeter.

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,397
Charles Vane of the Ranger.

283
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:26,205
The Negro gentleman
takes our goods, does he?

284
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:31,711
- Come on. We're off. Come on.
- Let's go.

285
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,045
That wasn't necessary.

286
00:18:41,118 --> 00:18:43,150
But fun, nonetheless.

287
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:47,328
I'd like a word in private.

288
00:18:47,393 --> 00:18:49,222
We have some business
to get sorted.

289
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:52,997
Wonderful.

290
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:06,541
I don't have time for this,
so if there's something...

291
00:19:06,606 --> 00:19:08,076
I want to talk about our business.

292
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:15,576
I noticed lately that my crew

293
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:18,614
hasn't been given the same
kind of information from you

294
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,150
about potential prizes
that we once did.

295
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:26,528
That others currently do receive.

296
00:19:28,024 --> 00:19:30,093
You've noticed that, have you?

297
00:19:30,158 --> 00:19:32,524
I believe it to be personal

298
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,764
and I'd like to put an end to it.

299
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:39,933
Things were better... are better

300
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:41,637
for the both of us

301
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:46,074
when you and I are on
the same side of things.

302
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:49,611
I would like to return to that.

303
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:52,312
You have an odd way of showing it.

304
00:19:52,377 --> 00:19:54,313
Excuse me?

305
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:57,246
I have responsibilities here...

306
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,614
commerce to oversee,
profits to maintain.

307
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,687
The idea that I would
withhold valuable leads

308
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:03,550
for personal reasons
is fucking absurd.

309
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:05,253
Is that so?

310
00:20:05,318 --> 00:20:06,590
I stopped providing you
with intelligence

311
00:20:06,655 --> 00:20:08,696
because I don't like
the way you run your ship.

312
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:12,060
Your men are undisciplined, unruly.

313
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,058
For as much money as they bring in,
they cause twice as much damage.

314
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,560
They're fucking animals.
You encourage it.

315
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,725
And that makes you
a poor investment.

316
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,856
You expect me to believe
this is about business?

317
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,096
I don't give a fuck what you believe.

318
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,593
I know that last night...
last night,

319
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:29,631
you killed a member of a crew
that has value to me

320
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,737
in order to depose a captain
that has value to me.

321
00:20:34,036 --> 00:20:36,937
And now not only do you
expect to be forgiven,

322
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,545
you wish to be rewarded for it.

323
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:40,644
Flint's so weak he needed
protection from you

324
00:20:40,716 --> 00:20:42,613
and I'm the poor investment?

325
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:47,281
From where I sit, you coming here
means one of two things.

326
00:20:47,354 --> 00:20:49,448
Either you're under the
illusion that with Flint gone,

327
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:52,623
I have no other choice
than to give you what you want

328
00:20:52,688 --> 00:20:54,917
or you think because
you and I used to fuck,

329
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:57,156
you can cross me
without any consequences.

330
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:59,722
(People shouting)

331
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:02,323
I'm not sure which of
the two is more stupid.

332
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:06,498
Be careful, Eleanor.

333
00:21:06,563 --> 00:21:08,635
Fuck you, Charles.

334
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,307
(Shouting continues)

335
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,505
MAN:
Captain says we're gonna be rich!

336
00:21:20,273 --> 00:21:22,710
Son of a bitch. You made it.

337
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:25,541
I did.

338
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:27,477
What happened?
I thought Singleton had the votes.

339
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,249
Turns out Mr. Singleton
was unfit for command.

340
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:34,043
We have more pressing
issues to attend to.

341
00:21:34,108 --> 00:21:35,545
Shall I wait?

342
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:38,809
Captain Vane was just leaving.

343
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:56,251
Hey, what the fuck
happened on that ship?

344
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,313
Where is Singleton?

345
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,852
Fruit. Fruit.

346
00:22:01,917 --> 00:22:05,019
Tits. Tits.

347
00:22:05,084 --> 00:22:07,283
Plant. Plant.

348
00:22:07,356 --> 00:22:09,556
It's the fucking same.

349
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:13,292
Yes, Captain, I'm sure
they look the same.

350
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,869
What the hell are you doing?

351
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:20,532
Watch this.

352
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,436
As I explained, this is the
work of Adriaen Hanneman.

353
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,340
A masterwork, unmistakably.

354
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:29,211
This is an abomination.

355
00:22:29,276 --> 00:22:31,443
To suggest that the value of one
has any bearing on the other

356
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,175
simply strains
the very bounds of reason.

357
00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:41,518
Fruit. Fruit.

358
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,082
Tits. Tits.

359
00:22:45,252 --> 00:22:46,682
I love this town.

360
00:22:46,754 --> 00:22:49,654
I'm so glad you're entertained.

361
00:22:49,719 --> 00:22:52,749
I'm sorry, weren't we supposed
to be looking for the cook?

362
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:55,989
- We are. Any luck?
- No, and I've looked all over.

363
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:58,555
Meanwhile, you haven't moved
from this stump all day.

364
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:01,362
Billy,

365
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,363
take a load off.

366
00:23:03,428 --> 00:23:08,330
Fruit. Fruit. Tits. Tits.
Plant. Plant.

367
00:23:10,634 --> 00:23:12,568
I've always been straight
with you, haven't I?

368
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:15,073
Never lied. Never hedged.

369
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:20,745
You did the right thing.

370
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:28,218
Yesterday when you sent me with
the captain to Harbour Island,

371
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:32,118
you told me to restrain him
if he tried to go too far.

372
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:34,021
I did.

373
00:23:34,086 --> 00:23:35,852
Singleton wasn't a thief.

374
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:38,753
Flint baited him into that fight,
then he killed him.

375
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:40,422
That's not going too far?

376
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,558
Singleton was no saint.

377
00:23:42,623 --> 00:23:44,588
That's not the point.
The point is I lied to my own crew

378
00:23:44,653 --> 00:23:46,323
to protect the captain.

379
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:48,655
You lied to protect the crew.

380
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,159
You saw the Scarborough, mate.

381
00:23:50,224 --> 00:23:51,927
You know what's coming.

382
00:23:53,896 --> 00:23:56,761
We can't thieve forever.

383
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:02,766
Flint said we need a king.

384
00:24:05,772 --> 00:24:07,267
Is that what you think?

385
00:24:08,836 --> 00:24:11,645
I think we need something.

386
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,815
Five million pieces
is a good place to start.

387
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:20,424
I guess we just keep looking, then.

388
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,992
No need.

389
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:24,487
- There's a man up there.
- Where?

390
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,327
- The brothel.
- Ah, the brothel.

391
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,767
Take them inside.

392
00:24:41,311 --> 00:24:43,309
Why are we following the appraiser?

393
00:24:43,374 --> 00:24:46,539
Because if I'm this cook and
I want to sell the schedule

394
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:49,881
and leave this place a rich man,
I need two things...

395
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,216
I need a boat and I need
a method of payment.

396
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:55,150
BILLY:
A method of payment?

397
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:57,917
What about gold coins?

398
00:24:57,982 --> 00:25:01,419
Gold is too heavy,
attracts too much attention.

399
00:25:01,484 --> 00:25:03,682
So I need a bill of exchange

400
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:06,153
- or...
- Jewels.

401
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:08,686
I was thinking pearls.

402
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:12,785
And I'd want to know the exact
value of what I'm getting.

403
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,788
- (Music playing)
- (Chatter)

404
00:25:28,687 --> 00:25:30,294
LOGAN:
Mr. Gates.

405
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:31,788
Hello, boys.

406
00:25:31,861 --> 00:25:33,995
Where the fuck have you two been?

407
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,661
(Laughs)
Come join us.

408
00:25:36,734 --> 00:25:38,627
We'll be right with you.

409
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,699
Any chance he's up
for a quick fuck?

410
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,002
With Anne Bonny standing guard?

411
00:25:47,772 --> 00:25:50,612
Excellent luster and orient.

412
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:55,010
Rest assured, young lady,
the quality is quite good.

413
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:58,787
200 pieces of eight at any clearinghouse
in the civilized colonies.

414
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:02,558
And the rest of them?

415
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:10,091
- No offense.
- None taken.

416
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:19,531
Sure I can't suck your cock
while you do that?

417
00:26:20,763 --> 00:26:23,033
Uh, thank you, no.

418
00:26:24,129 --> 00:26:27,273
Use my hand? Sing you a song?

419
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:29,738
Something worth paying money for?

420
00:26:29,803 --> 00:26:31,506
Fucking peepers.

421
00:26:35,914 --> 00:26:37,545
My father's under arrest?

422
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,544
A fugitive, technically.

423
00:26:39,617 --> 00:26:41,047
I have him on the Walrus.

424
00:26:41,112 --> 00:26:44,750
He was injured in the escape,
but he'll survive.

425
00:26:44,815 --> 00:26:47,022
Unfortunately, the same can't
be said for his reputation.

426
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:49,653
This is impossible.

427
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:52,219
He's been bribing
the Lords Proprietor for years.

428
00:26:52,292 --> 00:26:54,228
They've agreed to make
him governor here.

429
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:57,365
It would appear they've had
a change of heart.

430
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,330
You don't seem concerned about this.

431
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:01,663
I never much liked your father.

432
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:03,828
Too caught up in appearances.

433
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:06,059
She's not talking about
your opinion of the man.

434
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:08,098
Once news spreads
of Mr. Guthrie's arrest,

435
00:27:08,163 --> 00:27:09,960
our operation here
will no longer be viable.

436
00:27:10,033 --> 00:27:12,366
No legitimate port will have us.

437
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:15,426
And his ships, the ships that
take your cargo to market,

438
00:27:15,499 --> 00:27:17,064
if they are not impounded already,

439
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:19,064
will be on their way
back to Boston.

440
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:25,266
Captain, we are finished here.

441
00:27:25,332 --> 00:27:28,900
Under normal circumstances,
I'd agree with you.

442
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:31,938
- However...
- However what?

443
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:37,242
Let me tell you a story

444
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,239
about a Spaniard named Vazquez.

445
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:59,051
Happy to be of service.

446
00:28:03,552 --> 00:28:05,781
Thank you for your patience
in these matters.

447
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,355
You understand my partner
simply wishes to be careful.

448
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,016
I wouldn't fault him
in the slightest.

449
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,854
Now, shall we discuss delivery?

450
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:15,189
The wrecks at sundown.

451
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:18,217
Once he sees the pouch
with the seal unbroken,

452
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:20,426
he will hand over the page.

453
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:38,640
Is something wrong?

454
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:40,671
It's unclear
which is more appealing,

455
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:42,774
your beauty or your intelligence.

456
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:44,912
You are very kind, monsieur.

457
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:47,145
Well, let's not get carried away.

458
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:52,722
You.

459
00:28:52,787 --> 00:28:53,922
Is there a problem, Captain?

460
00:28:53,987 --> 00:28:56,690
She doesn't have your page.
Flint does.

461
00:28:56,763 --> 00:28:59,057
He killed Singleton,
took it off his body.

462
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,400
His crew's skipping around the island
like the prize is as good as theirs.

463
00:29:02,466 --> 00:29:04,952
That is impossible.
My partner has the page.

464
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:05,992
What?

465
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,374
Mr. Singleton is not the seller,
I assure you.

466
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:10,617
- What did you just say?
- RACKHAM: Charles.

467
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,480
Shut up, Jack.
You really want to keep pushing this?

468
00:29:13,553 --> 00:29:16,373
- Play me for a fool?
- You are mistaken.

469
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:17,874
- Yeah, the fuck I am.
- (Whimpers)

470
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,407
I need a weapon.

471
00:29:19,472 --> 00:29:21,638
Tell me the truth.

472
00:29:21,711 --> 00:29:24,138
- The page is gone.
- No.

473
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:26,104
Do you have a candlestick

474
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:29,209
or perhaps a heavy shoe?

475
00:29:29,274 --> 00:29:31,409
- That'll do.
- VANE: Play me for a fucking fool?

476
00:29:31,482 --> 00:29:34,144
- MAX: You are mistaken.
- VANE: Yeah, the fuck I am.

477
00:29:34,217 --> 00:29:36,446
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- (Whimpers)

478
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:38,981
She isn't lying, Charles.
Flint is.

479
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:40,852
- What?
- He lost the page.

480
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:42,584
So what does he do?
He bluffs.

481
00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:44,282
He makes Singleton
the thief and kills him

482
00:29:44,355 --> 00:29:45,818
to prevent counterargument,

483
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,054
putting a tidy end
to his mutiny in the process,

484
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,719
then hopes he can recover it
before anyone's the wiser.

485
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,160
Honestly, Charles, are we
to believe that Singleton,

486
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:55,527
while conspiring with you
to depose Flint,

487
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:58,493
was using this whore to try and
bilk your crew out of its money?

488
00:29:58,558 --> 00:29:59,796
Say what you want about Singleton,

489
00:29:59,861 --> 00:30:01,827
but he was neither
that clever nor that dumb.

490
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:04,565
Now will you please put her down so
we can complete our transaction?

491
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:07,437
Is that what you thought?
You could fuck us out of our money

492
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:09,173
and then hide behind Eleanor?

493
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:11,340
You think I'd really let that happen?

494
00:30:11,406 --> 00:30:13,644
You think I'm that fucking pathetic?

495
00:30:13,709 --> 00:30:15,877
Jesus, lady.

496
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:18,278
(Choking)

497
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:31,363
(Shouts)

498
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:53,015
Unless Mr. Singleton rose from
the grave to eavesdrop on us...

499
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:56,450
it would appear
she's telling the truth.

500
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,282
(Gasps)

501
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:02,722
If he's wrong about this,
he'll answer to our crew.

502
00:31:02,787 --> 00:31:06,596
If you're lying,
you'll answer to me.

503
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:11,404
(Max coughing)

504
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:13,369
Yes, all right.

505
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,801
(Panting)

506
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:19,072
The Urca de Lima?

507
00:31:19,137 --> 00:31:20,336
That's correct.

508
00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:22,579
You're talking about
a floating castle.

509
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:25,443
No one has ever taken a treasure
galleon like that as a prize.

510
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:27,282
Let me worry about hunting her.

511
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:29,752
It's what comes after
for which I'll need your help.

512
00:31:29,817 --> 00:31:32,554
After?
Why return at all to Nassau?

513
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,658
With money like that and my father
out of business, why not run?

514
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:38,890
What's coming our way
can't be outrun.

515
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:45,299
But with the money
I strip from the Hulk,

516
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,670
we could add 50 guns to the fort.

517
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:50,943
We could build ships
to defend our shores

518
00:31:51,008 --> 00:31:53,141
and train new men to sail them.

519
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:56,446
We could work the land,

520
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:58,817
grow crops and raise cattle.

521
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,193
Then whoever arrives
on our shores first,

522
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:04,764
be it England or Spain,

523
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:07,564
will be in for a most
unwelcome surprise.

524
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,574
- A nation of thieves.
- (Laughing)

525
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,215
You have your doubts?

526
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,043
Of turning pirates
into farmers and soldiers?

527
00:32:22,116 --> 00:32:26,112
Of fighting a war against Whitehall
from a sliver in the Atlantic?

528
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:28,182
Doubt, Captain Flint,

529
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:31,253
does not begin to describe
how I am feeling.

530
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:34,515
If there's to be a war, that
will be Whitehall's choice.

531
00:32:34,588 --> 00:32:36,787
I'd settle for a pardon,
title on lands,

532
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:38,290
and a governor that I could trust.

533
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:39,953
And so would most
of the men out there.

534
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:41,625
They're not animals, Mr. Scott.

535
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:43,121
They're men starved of hope.

536
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,053
Give that back to them,

537
00:32:45,126 --> 00:32:47,491
who's to say what could happen?

538
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,258
Why do this?

539
00:32:51,324 --> 00:32:53,498
Why here?

540
00:32:54,698 --> 00:32:59,940
Odysseus,
on his journey home to Ithaca,

541
00:33:00,005 --> 00:33:01,667
was visited by a ghost.

542
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:07,635
The ghost tells him
that once he reaches his home,

543
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,909
once he slays all his enemies

544
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:12,245
and sets his house in order,

545
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,878
he must do one last thing
before he can rest.

546
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:18,782
The ghost tells him
to pick up an oar

547
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,253
and walk inland.

548
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:23,287
And keep walking

549
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,256
until somebody mistakes
that oar for a shovel.

550
00:33:27,961 --> 00:33:29,799
For that would be
the place that no man

551
00:33:29,864 --> 00:33:31,600
had ever been troubled by the sea.

552
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:35,965
And that's where he'd find peace.

553
00:33:37,237 --> 00:33:39,134
In the end, that's all I want.

554
00:33:40,743 --> 00:33:43,909
To walk away from the sea
and find some peace.

555
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:47,181
(Door opens)

556
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:50,075
I think we found it.

557
00:33:50,148 --> 00:33:51,610
Found what?

558
00:33:51,682 --> 00:33:53,816
The Urca's schedule
was taken from me.

559
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,111
When were you planning
on mentioning that?

560
00:33:56,184 --> 00:33:58,487
Everything's under control.
We're close to recovering it.

561
00:33:58,552 --> 00:34:00,253
Vane just met with Frasier
at the brothel.

562
00:34:00,318 --> 00:34:01,946
I assume he's the buyer.

563
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:06,053
We missed the thief, but he's
using a whore as a go-between.

564
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:08,354
I left Billy
to keep an eye on things.

565
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:12,292
If we get moving, there's half a
chance to get in front of this.

566
00:34:12,365 --> 00:34:14,225
Find the cook...
(Voice fades)

567
00:34:22,738 --> 00:34:24,170
(Door opens)

568
00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:29,575
Good.
Maybe you can get her to talk.

569
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,080
- I'm fine.
- Huh, the fuck you are.

570
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:36,582
She nearly got herself
killed by Captain Vane.

571
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:38,644
I want to know why.

572
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:41,083
Leave us alone, Noonan.

573
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:44,285
Come on.

574
00:34:57,974 --> 00:35:00,216
- Max, I...
- I'm glad you are here.

575
00:35:00,281 --> 00:35:02,351
I was going to send word for you.

576
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:06,086
You and I have a decision to make
and it must be made right now.

577
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:09,457
I'm about to receive a great deal
of money for a service I provided.

578
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:12,130
Max, I need you
to give me the schedule.

579
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:14,195
Flint's schedule.

580
00:35:15,964 --> 00:35:17,634
When you were talking
this morning about being free

581
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,864
from Noonan,
that's what you meant, wasn't it?

582
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:22,303
How do you know this?

583
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:24,103
It doesn't matter.

584
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:27,141
Max, Flint needs that page.

585
00:35:27,206 --> 00:35:29,143
The money he can get
from his prize,

586
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:32,144
it can give this place a future.
It can give us a future here.

587
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:35,519
If the page isn't delivered to Vane,
he will kill me.

588
00:35:37,121 --> 00:35:38,953
I can protect you.

589
00:35:39,026 --> 00:35:41,657
Scott can protect you.
You have to trust me.

590
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:47,495
Leave with me.

591
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,428
- What?
- I have a boat waiting.

592
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:51,492
I will have enough money
for us to start anew.

593
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,333
- But I can't leave here.
- Why not?

594
00:35:54,799 --> 00:36:00,606
Because I've spent my life
trying to build something here.

595
00:36:00,671 --> 00:36:02,710
It's all I have.
I can't just walk away.

596
00:36:02,775 --> 00:36:04,246
It is not all you have!

597
00:36:04,311 --> 00:36:07,582
Eleanor, this place is just sand.

598
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,581
It cannot love you back.

599
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:11,621
You know this.
You must know this.

600
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:14,388
Your father left you.

601
00:36:14,454 --> 00:36:16,588
Your mother was taken from you.

602
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:18,722
Everyone you have
ever loved you have lost

603
00:36:18,787 --> 00:36:21,026
and it terrifies you.

604
00:36:21,091 --> 00:36:22,458
But not me.

605
00:36:22,523 --> 00:36:25,995
I will never, ever leave you.

606
00:36:26,068 --> 00:36:28,236
I love you.

607
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:34,110
- (Knocks)
- GATES: Miss Guthrie.

608
00:36:38,345 --> 00:36:41,121
- You brought them here?
- I...

609
00:36:49,703 --> 00:36:52,502
Come with me. Right now.

610
00:36:52,567 --> 00:36:55,742
The boat is waiting.
We can be free of this place.

611
00:36:55,807 --> 00:36:58,205
We can have a life together.

612
00:36:58,278 --> 00:37:00,175
And it can start this very minute.

613
00:37:00,248 --> 00:37:02,848
All you have to do is say yes.

614
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:07,322
Set us both free.

615
00:37:16,023 --> 00:37:17,523
Come in.

616
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:19,524
(Door opens)

617
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:29,297
Max, I need you to tell me
where the page is.

618
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,909
And if I don't, then what?

619
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:41,290
This doesn't have to go badly.

620
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:42,924
I want her to say it.

621
00:37:42,997 --> 00:37:45,363
I want her to say that
she would sit there and watch

622
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:48,597
as you beat the answer
out of me to save this place.

623
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:51,734
Say it.

624
00:37:58,113 --> 00:37:59,947
Say it.

625
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,423
The wrecks at sundown.

626
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:24,613
- Max, please.
- Get the fuck out.

627
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:26,445
I meant what I said.
I can protect you.

628
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:28,578
Get the fuck out!

629
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:37,920
- (Sobbing)
- (Door closes)

630
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:13,744
(Men chattering)

631
00:39:21,357 --> 00:39:23,860
- Frightened, Jack?
- Please.

632
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:26,398
There's nothing in there
but opium addicts,

633
00:39:26,471 --> 00:39:29,899
lunatics, and men who thought
themselves too good to wear a condom.

634
00:40:10,906 --> 00:40:13,113
The pearls.

635
00:40:13,178 --> 00:40:16,116
He says you give me the pearls.

636
00:40:19,689 --> 00:40:22,824
Did he say anything else?

637
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:34,270
No. I want him out here.

638
00:40:34,335 --> 00:40:36,405
Captain.

639
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:38,604
I know you can hear me!

640
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:41,340
You want your money,
you show your fucking face!

641
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:43,810
That's the only way this gets done.

642
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,713
Captain, I'm afraid
our friend out there

643
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,784
has all the leverage in
this particular situation.

644
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,051
Now, we can rail and shout
and stamp our feet,

645
00:40:53,116 --> 00:40:55,252
but that doesn't change the fact
that unless we give this fellow...

646
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:57,387
(Groans)

647
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:07,334
You were saying?

648
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:14,649
Now, come out here and face me

649
00:41:14,714 --> 00:41:16,914
or these pearls go back
where they belong!

650
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:20,019
Fuck.

651
00:41:23,258 --> 00:41:25,456
RACKHAM:
Charles, it is important

652
00:41:25,521 --> 00:41:27,327
this deal goes through tonight.

653
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:30,557
This is a potential prize
that changes everything for us.

654
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,132
- Do not scuttle it by...
- (Soft clatter)

655
00:41:51,214 --> 00:41:55,121
He says you give me the pearls.

656
00:42:07,669 --> 00:42:09,772
(Gunshot echoes)

657
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:22,320
Ah!

658
00:44:26,762 --> 00:44:28,927
(Screams)

659
00:44:41,982 --> 00:44:43,814
(Gasps)

660
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:47,086
(Coughing)

661
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,968
(Grunts)

662
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,640
- Where's the page?
- You can't have it.

663
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:08,872
Not at the moment.
And, please, we should go.

664
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:10,008
Where have you hidden it?

665
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:12,774
You're looking at it.

666
00:45:12,847 --> 00:45:14,712
What the fuck
are you talking about?

667
00:45:14,785 --> 00:45:18,615
Well, I couldn't be certain I would
escape both the madman and you,

668
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:21,628
so I took drastic measures

669
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:23,827
for the sake of my survival.

670
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:32,500
Your schedule is up here.

671
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:52,052
Fuck!

672
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:54,822
You don't have to do this.

673
00:45:57,458 --> 00:46:00,494
Mr. Noonan has men at your door.

674
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,064
And Guthrie's put
three more downstairs.

675
00:46:07,003 --> 00:46:08,842
Vane can't get to you here.

676
00:46:08,907 --> 00:46:10,842
I know.

677
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:12,979
But I cannot stay.

678
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:18,683
Will you help me?

679
00:47:09,213 --> 00:47:11,014
(Sniffles)

680
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:14,583
Meet our thief.

681
00:47:14,655 --> 00:47:18,254
- Why is he still alive?
- It's a long story.

682
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:20,560
Do you mind if we stash
him here for the night?

683
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:22,665
Billy can stand guard.

684
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:48,855
Flint will want
our answer in the morning.

685
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,791
(Pouring liquid)

686
00:47:50,856 --> 00:47:53,761
I know you don't approve of this,

687
00:47:53,826 --> 00:47:55,634
but I need to do this.

688
00:47:55,699 --> 00:47:57,130
I need it.

689
00:48:05,571 --> 00:48:07,545
Please.

690
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:11,547
Stay with me.

691
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,087
All right.

692
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:22,061
(Sighs)

693
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:28,166

- (Whooping and cheering)

694
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:13,509
(Fortepiano playing)

695
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,193
(Playing)

696
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,578
(Horse whinnying)

697
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:40,081
(Stops playing)

698
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,379
(Door opens)

699
00:49:54,267 --> 00:49:56,168
Take off your boots.

700
00:49:56,233 --> 00:49:57,903
I'll boil some water.

701
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:07,541
(Grunts)

702
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:15,550
(Exhales)
