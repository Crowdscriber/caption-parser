collide it, collapse it, contain it.

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,118
He said he might come over.

162
00:08:21,153 --> 00:08:23,154
Dad, I got it.
It's okay.

163
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:28,526
Hey, Sergeant B!
Hello.

164
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:30,529
Is it true you're
running for Congress?

165
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:31,730
Yeah.
Are you?

166
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,398
You 18?
No felonies?

167
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,868
No, none yet.
All right.

168
00:08:35,902 --> 00:08:38,337
How are you?
Good.

169
00:08:38,372 --> 00:08:39,705
Hey, Mrs. B!

170
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:42,708
Well, you obviously didn't tell Xander

171
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:43,975
we're leaving for a couple days.

172
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,376
It's a whole couple of days now?

173
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,644
JESSICA:
It's just overnight.

174
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:48,079
Xander, uh, why don't you tell them

175
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,580
about those tickets
that you already bought?

176
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:51,648
What-what tickets?

177
00:08:51,683 --> 00:08:53,417
Dana, you're going.

178
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,152
You know, I could stay here by myself.
No, you can't.

179
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:58,421
You know, I could stay with her.
You're kidding, right?

180
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,923
Dana, we've already discussed this.

181
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:01,592
Come Monday, the campaign's
gonna take over,

182
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,894
you're not gonna see your father

183
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:05,529
for days at a time.
He just wants

184
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:06,897
to spend one last weekend
with the four of us.

185
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:08,432
I don't think it's too much to ask.

186
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,402
Okay, I give up. I'll go.

187
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:13,638
Mmm!

188
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:17,709
Yeah, I'll go.

189
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:23,914
Hi. Dr. Jeremy.

190
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:24,914
Where's Dr. Steiner?

191
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:25,949
Not here today.

192
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:29,052
You're the doctor?

193
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,920
(sighs) I've been waiting
a half an hour.

194
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:32,254
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,523
I mean, I got a real situation here.

196
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:36,558
I'm aware.
I spoke with Carrie earlier.

197
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:38,693
Well, then you can explain to me
what's going on.

198
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,796
As far as her injuries go,
Carrie is fine.

199
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,764
I already heard that.

200
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:45,935
I-I-I mean, um...

201
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,604
how she's acting.

202
00:09:47,638 --> 00:09:49,439
I'm sorry. I have to speak
with Carrie privately.

203
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:51,107
I'd like to come.
She'll allow it.

204
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:55,579
Saul, there you are.

205
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:56,980
Hey, how you feeling, Carrie?

206
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:58,549
Is it time yet?
Are we going?

207
00:09:58,583 --> 00:09:59,783
Going?

208
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:01,251
To work. We gotta hop-to.

209
00:10:01,286 --> 00:10:03,053
We gotta haul ass to Langley.

210
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:05,088
They have to understand, Saul.

211
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:08,657
Nazir's movements in green after
a fallow yellow always creeping

212
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:12,227
towards purple are
methodical, meaningful

213
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,430
momentous and monstrous.

214
00:10:14,464 --> 00:10:16,298
Okay, I'm gonna get you
a bit more Ativan

215
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:17,399
to settle you down.

216
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:18,933
I don't need to settle down!

217
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,169
Tell him!

218
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,105
Saul, tell him.

219
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,507
Carrie...

220
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,309
you're not yourself.

221
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:30,078
Of course I am!

222
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:33,181
No. I can't follow you.

223
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,283
You're talking very fast.

224
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:38,786
Your thoughts are running together.

225
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:42,524
All these ideas...

226
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,827
I-I... I can't understand.

227
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:54,869
Is there a doctor we should call?

228
00:11:04,648 --> 00:11:06,883
My sister.

229
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,029
Honey, is this really necessary?

230
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:20,665
Complain to Ma, she's the one
that got it for me.

231
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,467
Really?
Careful, careful! I'm driving.

232
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:25,736
Jack me to Gettysburg,
and this is what you get.

233
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,371
Okay, here it is.

234
00:11:28,406 --> 00:11:31,341
"Four score and seven years ago
our fathers brought forth on

235
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,410
"this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty

236
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:39,548
and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created equal."

237
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,250
What's four score?

238
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,318
Four times 20.

239
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:44,554
Lincoln means "87 years ago."

240
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:49,225
He's talking about the American
Revolution of 1776.

241
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:51,594
Why didn't he just say that?

242
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,097
You'll see when we get there.

243
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,999
How far are we now?

244
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:57,834
Three score miles.

245
00:11:57,868 --> 00:12:00,270
(all chuckle)

246
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:03,340
Hey, come on.

247
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:04,575
Holy shit!

248
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,043
Dana! Really?

249
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:07,678
I'm sorry.
I just hadn't realized

250
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,381
Dad's scars were so faded.

251
00:12:10,415 --> 00:12:12,883
I mean, you can barely see 'em now.

252
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:28,632
She'll be here, right?

253
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,467
I mean, she said she was on her way?

254
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:31,735
Maggie will come.
Maggie's reliable.

255
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,237
You can count on Maggie every time.

256
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:34,539
(chuckles)

257
00:12:34,573 --> 00:12:37,308
Is she an especially slow driver?

258
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:39,443
Okay...
Huh?

259
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:43,882
This is red <i>and</i> blue,
it's not red <i>or</i> blue. Okay.

260
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,717
Maybe she got pulled over.

261
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:47,318
(mutters):
Shit...

262
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:49,821
Sleeping dogs here,
sleeping dogs there.

263
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:53,458
This whole box is dogs, really.

264
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,130
She can fix this, right?

265
00:12:59,164 --> 00:13:00,898
She said she was bringing medication.

266
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:03,001
The question is what wakes them?

267
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:06,338
Is it a whisper, a crash,
a deep internal pain?

268
00:13:06,372 --> 00:13:08,840
How about a glass of water?
(doorbell rings)

269
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:17,416
Hi.
Hi.

270
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,486
She's manic?
I don't know, you tell me.

271
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:25,760
Hi, Carrie.

272
00:13:25,794 --> 00:13:27,194
Hi, Maggie.

273
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,130
You look so professional.

274
00:13:31,534 --> 00:13:33,502
So this isn't new?

275
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:37,507
No. She's bi-polar.

276
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,842
She's stable on her meds.

277
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,145
The explosion must have
sent her into a flight.

278
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:44,147
Why didn't she ever tell me?

279
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,449
She said no one at work could know.

280
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:47,984
Right.

281
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:50,520
So what do we do?

282
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:51,988
We'll up her Lithium.

283
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:55,392
We're giving her Clonazepam
to start leveling her out.

284
00:13:58,563 --> 00:13:59,964
Carrie?

285
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:17,848
Is it essential, entirely?

286
00:14:17,883 --> 00:14:19,850
Yeah, it is.

287
00:14:22,854 --> 00:14:24,221
Here you go.

288
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,372
So that's it?
She'll be fine by what, morning?

289
00:14:42,406 --> 00:14:44,741
No. It takes time. Days.

290
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:47,276
Maybe a week.
Oh, that long?

291
00:14:47,311 --> 00:14:49,278
And someone needs to watch her

292
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:50,846
while she's evening out.

293
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,015
Full-time?

294
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:56,684
Or we put her in the psych ward.

295
00:14:56,718 --> 00:15:00,287
Well, that would kill
her security clearance forever.

296
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,389
That's why I treat her.

297
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:07,027
Well...

298
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:08,762
I got to get back to work.

299
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,032
I can stay till 7:00.

300
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,601
Can you take the night shift?

301
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:17,404
Well, what do I have to do?

302
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,239
Just be with her.

303
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:20,940
Keep her out of trouble.

304
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:23,777
Okay. 7:00.

305
00:15:33,355 --> 00:15:34,956
(elevator bell dings)

306
00:15:48,371 --> 00:15:50,005
(door buzzes)

307
00:15:56,678 --> 00:16:00,113
Welcome to my goddamn humble abode.

308
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:01,749
Want to tell me where we stand?

309
00:16:01,783 --> 00:16:04,084
We've been coordinating security
with your secret service detail.

310
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:06,721
Well, I've been in here
for eight hours.

311
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,992
At present, the threat...

312
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:12,693
The threat is one fucking guy.

313
00:16:12,727 --> 00:16:15,629
Marine sniper, sir, highly trained.

314
00:16:15,663 --> 00:16:19,799
Do you see where I am?
Do you?

315
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:23,003
I'm underground cowering out of sight,

316
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:25,271
at a time when I need
to be highly visible.

317
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:27,940
I'm announcing my candidacy next week
for President of the United States.

318
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,475
You may need to push that back, sir.

319
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,043
I'm not going to push that back...
Sorry...

320
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:33,445
I am not going to push that back.
That date is set.

321
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:36,047
And I'm not going to do it from here.

322
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,983
Vote for the fucking cave dweller

323
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:40,152
just because you
can't locate Tom Walker.

324
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,720
Yes, sir.

325
00:16:41,754 --> 00:16:43,522
So fix it.

326
00:16:48,395 --> 00:16:51,664
Sir, there's something you should know.
What's that?

327
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,333
The C-4 used in the explosion--

328
00:16:53,367 --> 00:16:54,968
we sourced it to a Saudi shipment.

329
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:56,570
Oh...

330
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:59,039
It was delivered last year
to Prince Sultan Air Base.

331
00:16:59,074 --> 00:17:01,008
Part of a large arms
deal that came in...

332
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,577
Why do you do this?
What's that, sir?

333
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:05,645
Tell me things I don't want to hear.

334
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,514
We've got two Muslims
dead in a mosque,

335
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,415
an explosion in
the streets of D.C.

336
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,184
and Walker who the fuck knows where?

337
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:13,752
You want your portrait up on the
walls at Langley someday?

338
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:17,122
Focus on that. Find Walker.

339
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,858
Yes, sir.

340
00:17:20,893 --> 00:17:23,995
And fire someone.

341
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,863
I don't care who.

342
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:45,249
CHRIS:
That's it?

343
00:17:45,283 --> 00:17:47,217
BRODY:
Yep. That's it.

344
00:17:47,252 --> 00:17:49,453
CHRIS:
Can we go now?

345
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,721
Only if you can tell
me what happened here.

346
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:53,189
Battle of Gettysburg.

347
00:17:53,224 --> 00:17:55,091
Can you be more specific?

348
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:57,360
Four score and...

349
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:59,662
I didn't know I'd be tested.

350
00:18:02,466 --> 00:18:05,636
Okay, we're in Pennsylvania, right?

351
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,573
Was that the South or the North?

352
00:18:08,607 --> 00:18:11,543
God. North.

353
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:13,778
That's right.

354
00:18:13,813 --> 00:18:16,448
General Lee had brought
the war to the North.

355
00:18:16,482 --> 00:18:19,618
The South was winning.

356
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:24,222
The Northern forces were outnumbered,
and they were on the run.

357
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:26,257
Then they dug in there.

358
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:29,127
All along that ridge.

359
00:18:29,162 --> 00:18:32,798
General Meade, the Northern general,

360
00:18:32,832 --> 00:18:35,301
he drew a line out there

361
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,303
and he gave instructions to his troops

362
00:18:37,337 --> 00:18:39,338
to defend it at all costs.

363
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:41,006
And that means with your life.

364
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,309
What happened?

365
00:18:43,343 --> 00:18:45,778
They prayed.

366
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:48,347
Both sides did.

367
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,918
These were extremely religious people.

368
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:55,521
I meant what happened
with the fighting?

369
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,959
Well, imagine...

370
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:07,700
You're bone tired,
you're cut off from water.

371
00:19:07,734 --> 00:19:11,170
The most crucial part of
the line that must be held

372
00:19:11,204 --> 00:19:12,604
it's right up there.

373
00:19:12,639 --> 00:19:14,273
You see up there, that little hill?

374
00:19:14,307 --> 00:19:16,509
It's Little Round Top.

375
00:19:16,543 --> 00:19:20,813
There are just 300 of you.

376
00:19:20,847 --> 00:19:24,883
You're commanded by
a school teacher from Maine.

377
00:19:24,918 --> 00:19:28,820
When suddenly, 2,000 enemy soldiers

378
00:19:28,855 --> 00:19:31,623
come charging out of those trees,

379
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:34,493
screaming at the top of their lungs,

380
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,661
determined to cut you down.

381
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:38,463
Did they?

382
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:40,465
They charged twice.

383
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,634
And then a third time.

384
00:19:44,403 --> 00:19:47,206
And that's when this teacher
from Maine--

385
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:52,011
Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain
was his name...

386
00:19:53,914 --> 00:19:56,249
...asked his men
to do a very strange thing.

387
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:57,884
What?

388
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,487
He told them to stop shooting.

389
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:03,857
No guns, just bayonets.

390
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,825
And instead of shooting

391
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,497
they charged down the side of
that hill toward the enemy.

392
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:15,402
And it was so unexpected,
it was so crazy,

393
00:20:15,437 --> 00:20:17,939
that the line was held that day.

394
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,776
All because of a school teacher

395
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,882
from Maine, who was willing
to do what was necessary

396
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:29,818
for a cause that he believed in.

397
00:20:38,429 --> 00:20:41,063
Saul.

398
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:42,932
Where've you been?

399
00:20:42,966 --> 00:20:44,734
You told me to get Carrie, remember?

400
00:20:44,768 --> 00:20:45,968
Where is she?

401
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:47,403
Keeping her another day.

402
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:49,938
Perfect.

403
00:20:49,973 --> 00:20:51,406
Hey, David.

404
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:57,078
She said something interesting.
Of course she did.

405
00:20:57,112 --> 00:21:00,648
Sniper attack-- that doesn't
make sense for Abu Nazir.

406
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,818
It's not his methodology.

407
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:05,588
Well, maybe it is when he has a
military sniper working for him.

408
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:07,156
She thinks something bigger.

409
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,593
Marine One all over the wire.
New references to Marine Two.

410
00:21:10,628 --> 00:21:13,397
The two leaders of the free world
aren't fancy enough targets for you?

411
00:21:13,431 --> 00:21:15,332
She says it's a sideshow.

412
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:18,736
If she wants to get her ass in to work
I'll be happy to bat that around with her.

413
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:20,838
Right.
And it better be soon,

414
00:21:20,873 --> 00:21:22,507
because the Vice President's
about to fire us all.

415
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:25,643
She just got blown up, David.
Might not be tomorrow.

416
00:21:25,677 --> 00:21:27,044
Why, what's the problem?

417
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,113
Doctor's orders.

418
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:46,696
Dad.

419
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,269
Yeah?

420
00:21:51,303 --> 00:21:53,137
You okay?

421
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:56,942
Yeah.

422
00:21:56,976 --> 00:21:59,378
Yeah, I was just thinking.

423
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:00,880
Where'd your mom go?

424
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:03,349
Gift shop with Chris.

425
00:22:05,385 --> 00:22:08,688
I had no idea that you knew so much.

426
00:22:08,722 --> 00:22:11,725
About Gettysburg?
About anything.

427
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:14,361
(chuckles)

428
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:16,564
I mean, I know
you're a Marine and all,

429
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:18,900
and I shouldn't be surprised.

430
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:24,706
Anyway, I get why
you wanted to come here.

431
00:22:26,942 --> 00:22:30,045
Can you promise me something?

432
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,548
Yeah. What?

433
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:41,523
I have this feeling that things are
going to get pretty wild soon.

434
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:45,060
Geez, Dad, it's just a campaign.

435
00:22:45,094 --> 00:22:47,896
Your mom's going to need you.

436
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:50,232
When I'm not around.

437
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:56,972
Promise me you'll watch out for her.

438
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,444
Promise me.

439
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:04,447
CHRIS:
Hey, look what we got.

440
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:08,985
Yeah, I promise.

441
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:12,956
You want one?

442
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,691
Oh, that's fantastic.

443
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,959
One for you.

444
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,127
That's great.

445
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:18,529
I don't get a general's hat?

446
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,897
I'm the boss around here, that's why.

447
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,031
You are.

448
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:23,467
Let's see you salute.

449
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:27,972
Hi-oh.
Corporal First Class.

450
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:31,375
How do you have no food in your house?

451
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,244
I eat out.

452
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,913
You eat Chinese take-out
and yogurt.

453
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,716
You ever hear of the four food groups?

454
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,319
Yes. But I won't recite them
because I'm resting my mind.

455
00:23:42,353 --> 00:23:44,922
I know you hate this.

456
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,790
I have a lot of work to do.

457
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:47,991
You always say that.

458
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,293
No, no, something big is
happening. Something dangerous.

459
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,964
There's no time for rest.
I know you feel that.

460
00:23:53,998 --> 00:23:56,066
But you'll need to trust
my judgment now.

461
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,302
You need rest, healthy meals,
patience.

462
00:24:08,478 --> 00:24:10,645
Carrie! Carrie,
what are you doing?

463
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,980
Carrie!
(horn honking)

464
00:24:12,014 --> 00:24:13,181
(tires squealing)

465
00:24:13,215 --> 00:24:14,549
Carrie!

466
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:22,322
(car door opening and closing)

467
00:24:22,356 --> 00:24:24,157
What are you doing?

468
00:24:24,192 --> 00:24:26,159
What the hell are you doing?!

469
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:27,660
Look at this.

470
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:29,028
You have to stay with me.

471
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:30,330
Isn't this amazing?

472
00:24:30,364 --> 00:24:32,298
We're going home.

473
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,667
Somewhere down there, there's
a sliver of green

474
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:36,168
just-just taking its time.

475
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:39,972
This is-- this is how
everything works.

476
00:24:40,006 --> 00:24:42,542
Carrie...

477
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:47,180
You wait, you lay low, and then...

478
00:24:47,215 --> 00:24:50,050
Then you come to life.

479
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,155
Come on.

480
00:24:54,189 --> 00:24:55,856
Come on.

481
00:24:58,828 --> 00:25:00,495
(panting)

482
00:25:11,206 --> 00:25:13,840
So what do you want to eat, guys?

483
00:25:13,874 --> 00:25:15,708
I don't know.

484
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:18,143
What do we got?
Should we try this place?

485
00:25:18,178 --> 00:25:20,847
Oh, babe, you know what?
I forgot my toothbrush.

486
00:25:20,881 --> 00:25:22,548
I'm going to go pick one up.
Okay.

487
00:25:22,582 --> 00:25:24,250
All right? Will you get me
something to eat?

488
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:25,685
Will you get me a burger?

489
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:29,322
Chocolate shake?
Okay.

490
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:06,589
<i>As-salaamu alaykum.</i>

491
00:26:06,624 --> 00:26:11,427
<i>Wa alaykum assalaam wa ramat</i>
<i>allahi wa barakatuhu.</i>

492
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:15,131
I don't have much time.

493
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:29,345
(clears throat)

494
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:36,319
Put your arm through here.

495
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,732
The explosive?

496
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:49,300
Not armed yet.

497
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:50,968
Listen now.

498
00:26:53,506 --> 00:26:57,609
These must be tight.

499
00:26:57,644 --> 00:27:00,812
Or the vest will show.

500
00:27:00,846 --> 00:27:03,615
The switch is here.

501
00:27:05,817 --> 00:27:07,318
Under this cover.

502
00:27:07,352 --> 00:27:12,589
Wait until the last second
before you open it.

503
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:15,358
Some people get nervous.

504
00:27:15,392 --> 00:27:20,363
You don't want your hand
on the switch until the end.

505
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:44,456
I read that part of the
blast goes upward.

506
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:46,959
Toward here.

507
00:27:46,993 --> 00:27:48,994
Point of weakness.

508
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:54,165
So that the head is cleanly severed,

509
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,502
and normally found intact.

510
00:27:57,536 --> 00:28:00,938
Everything else...

511
00:28:02,174 --> 00:28:03,941
...isn't.

512
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:11,684
(speaking Arabic)

513
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:23,463
<i>La ilaha illa Allah.</i>

514
00:28:30,804 --> 00:28:32,671
(train whistle blows)

515
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:06,405
DANA:
Where were you?

516
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,108
Huh?

517
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:11,077
What was that? That package?

518
00:29:11,112 --> 00:29:14,481
Oh, that was just something for Mom.

519
00:29:14,516 --> 00:29:17,084
What?

520
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:18,953
That was a present.

521
00:29:18,988 --> 00:29:20,655
You get me something to eat?

522
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,257
Yeah. It's getting cold.

523
00:29:22,291 --> 00:29:23,658
Okay.

524
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:25,327
Is something wrong?

525
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:26,561
No. Why?

526
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:29,998
You just sound weird.

527
00:29:30,032 --> 00:29:32,601
Come on.

528
00:29:32,635 --> 00:29:35,638
What'd you get, a burger?
Yeah.

529
00:29:35,672 --> 00:29:37,673
Sweet potato fries.

530
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,008
I already put ketchup on it.

531
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,610
I can't put it in the milkshake now.

532
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:43,079
Get another one.
Chris...

533
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,581
CHRIS: Eat it.
You eat it.

534
00:29:44,615 --> 00:29:46,649
I already, I...
Try it.

535
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,352
Hey, Dad, isn't this where we were?

536
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,254
Chris, did you steal all my fries?

537
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:52,689
Sorry. We were hungry.
Yeah.

538
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,191
Totally okay.

539
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:56,493
In there, up here.
That's us there, Little Round Top.

540
00:29:56,527 --> 00:29:57,694
MAN:
Excuse me?

541
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:02,632
You're that soldier back from Iraq.

542
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,301
One of them.

543
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:05,836
You're the hero.

544
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,805
Running for office.

545
00:30:09,374 --> 00:30:11,975
I'm no hero, sir.

546
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:14,478
Well, whatever you call it,

547
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,513
you're one tough motherfucker.

548
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:21,484
Man, what
you went through--

549
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,653
kind of puts things in perspective.

550
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,724
I'd vote for you.

551
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:38,468
Thank you, sir.
Pleased to meet you.

552
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,636
I'm waiting to hear
what you have to say.

553
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,138
I'm sure it's going to be good.

554
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:44,506
Hey, this is my son Jimmy.
Hey, Jimmy.

555
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:47,409
We run a construction
business locally.

556
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:51,013
To be honest...

557
00:31:03,926 --> 00:31:06,161
Hi.
Hi.

558
00:31:06,196 --> 00:31:08,030
She's upstairs.
Took her meds already.

559
00:31:08,065 --> 00:31:09,665
Good.

560
00:31:14,238 --> 00:31:15,838
She was working.

561
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:24,045
There was an incident today.

562
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,014
What happened?

563
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:29,717
She almost got hit by a car.

564
00:31:29,751 --> 00:31:32,086
She's okay.
She's fine.

565
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,922
But I had to give her
another sedative.

566
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:37,457
She really needs to rest.

567
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,859
Okay.

568
00:31:39,893 --> 00:31:42,729
I'll go see her.

569
00:31:42,763 --> 00:31:46,566
She's probably asleep already.
You don't have to.

570
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,134
I want to.

571
00:31:48,168 --> 00:31:50,036
I'll see you tomorrow.

572
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:03,951
Saul.

573
00:32:05,586 --> 00:32:07,954
Sorry I didn't say
good-bye this morning.

574
00:32:07,988 --> 00:32:10,423
Did you see the papers?
Downstairs-- the work?

575
00:32:10,457 --> 00:32:11,590
I did.

576
00:32:12,692 --> 00:32:14,260
(sighs)

577
00:32:14,294 --> 00:32:16,628
There's so much more to do.

578
00:32:16,663 --> 00:32:19,765
I'm just so sleepy.

579
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:23,736
That's okay. Rest.

580
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:26,139
Maggie upped my meds.
I shouldn't have let her.

581
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:29,610
They're making me so drowsy.

582
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:33,915
(sighs)

583
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:36,785
Carrie?

584
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:39,855
I'm so sorry.

585
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:42,224
About all this.

586
00:32:45,195 --> 00:32:49,264
I feel responsible in a way.

587
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:53,467
'Cause when you came back
from Baghdad, I knew.

588
00:32:53,502 --> 00:32:56,270
I saw something had happened.

589
00:32:56,305 --> 00:32:58,673
You were damaged.

590
00:33:02,144 --> 00:33:04,512
I left it alone.

591
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:08,883
Other times when you were so...

592
00:33:08,917 --> 00:33:12,352
out there, I guess I half knew.

593
00:33:12,387 --> 00:33:15,622
Maybe hoping it was something else.

594
00:33:15,656 --> 00:33:20,359
Anyway, I should have asked.

595
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:23,896
I should have asked
if you were really okay.

596
00:33:29,369 --> 00:33:31,270
There's no time, Saul.

597
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,041
It's high purple.

I need more ice.

605

It's free.

You glad we came?
Yeah.

608
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:28,217
The guy at the diner was funny.

609
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:29,518
Yeah.

610
00:36:29,552 --> 00:36:30,852
Did you like Gettysburg?

Yeah, it was cool.

I wanted you to understand.

00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:38,560
That the Civil War, all wars,

614
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:40,762
they turn everything upside down.

615

Everything and everyone.

616
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,836
I hope that you'll remember

617
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,006
Joshua Chamberlain when you get older.

618
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:54,044
And be brave, and daring,

619
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,413
and ready to fight
for what you believe in.

620
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,714
Dad...

621
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,283
What?

622
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:02,286
Do you mind if we talk
about this some other time?

623
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,820
It's kind of melting.

624
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:27,644
Tell your sister to go to bed soon.

625
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:30,214
Okay.

626
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,082
Good night.

627
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,419
Good night.

628
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:54,138
I told Chris to get to bed.

629
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:55,473
(Chris and Dana arguing)

630
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,109
(laughing)

631
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,746
I'll give him a direct
order next time.

632
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:09,122
What?

633
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,857
Why the big smile?

634
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:12,525
Just happy to see you, that's all.

635
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,661
Yeah?

636
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:17,998
I really think this trip
was a great idea.

637
00:38:18,032 --> 00:38:20,768
It's like something's changed.

638
00:38:20,802 --> 00:38:22,369
Like we've turned this corner,

639
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:26,707
and everything doesn't have
to be so difficult anymore.

640
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:30,777
When I was watching you
at dinner with those people,

641
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:33,279
how much they need you.

642
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:35,681
I don't think they were
even from our district.

643
00:38:35,715 --> 00:38:38,016
(laughing) I know.

644
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,619
But I could see it.

645
00:38:40,653 --> 00:38:43,722
How you're this promise.

646
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:46,491
That things could be better.

647
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:52,498
I wish that I had never said
no to your running for office.

648
00:38:52,532 --> 00:38:55,301
'Cause I see now what
a good thing it is.

649
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:58,071
Not just for other people...

650
00:38:58,105 --> 00:39:00,040
for us, too.

651
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:09,650
Brody, I'm...

652
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:13,053
What?

653
00:39:14,556 --> 00:39:16,390
...happy.

654
00:39:39,883 --> 00:39:42,752
It's like you're finally home.

655
00:39:56,436 --> 00:39:58,804
(whispers):
The kids are next door.

656
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:00,273
Shh, shh, shh...

657
00:40:00,307 --> 00:40:02,308
(giggles)

658
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,901
(birds chirping in distance)

659
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:05,170
(chuckles)

660
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,308
(chuckles)

661
00:41:09,343 --> 00:41:11,210
You understand.

662
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:14,281
It's a timeline.

663
00:41:14,315 --> 00:41:18,219
Yes! It's Abu Nazir's
activities.

664
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:19,387
Were you up all night?

665
00:41:19,421 --> 00:41:21,388
More or less.

666
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:27,895
The fallow yellow.

667
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,363
He went quiet for months.

668
00:41:29,398 --> 00:41:30,998
No videos, no meetings.
But then?

669
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:33,334
He came to life again with purpose.
More than ever.

670
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:35,502
But why the hibernation?
What happened?

671
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:38,238
Injury? Bad health?

672
00:41:38,273 --> 00:41:40,740
Or loss.

673
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:41,975
Tragedy.

674
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:44,411
He was mourning during the yellow.

675
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:48,882
And then green was revenge.

676
00:41:48,916 --> 00:41:50,183
It was a plan.

677
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:53,319
And now... the purple.

678
00:41:53,354 --> 00:41:56,088
He's ready to see it through.

679
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:57,556
It's here.

680
00:41:57,590 --> 00:41:59,691
We have to figure out what
happened right here.

681
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,260
I'll get the A team on it
this morning.

682
00:42:01,294 --> 00:42:03,328
Galvez--
he can find anything.

683
00:42:03,363 --> 00:42:04,830
That's a good idea.

684
00:42:04,864 --> 00:42:06,865
(sighs)

685
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,667
What about me?

686
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:11,469
You relax.

687
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,886
I did hear you last night.

688
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,488
You did?

689
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,828
I've had this since college.

690
00:42:38,798 --> 00:42:43,535
I wrote a 45-page manifesto
declaring I'd reinvented music.

691
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:45,136
(chuckles)

692
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:48,306
The professor I handed it to
escorted me to Student Health.

693
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,074
Ah.

694
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,511
(chuckles) I wasn't even in his class.

695
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,952
You didn't do anything, Saul.

696
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,959
I just came this way.

697
00:43:08,429 --> 00:43:11,498
(knocking)

698
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:12,933
(door opens)

699
00:43:14,002 --> 00:43:15,937
Dad wanted to be here.

700
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:19,207
You bet I did.
Hey, how's my girl, huh?

701
00:43:24,546 --> 00:43:26,514
What is that?

702
00:43:26,548 --> 00:43:29,350
It's her work.

703
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:32,853
That's goddamned glorious.

704
00:43:32,887 --> 00:43:34,588
It should be in the National Galley.

705
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:36,456
Dad, this is Saul.

706
00:43:36,491 --> 00:43:38,792
Hey. Frank Mathison.

707
00:43:38,826 --> 00:43:40,026
I hear you look out for her.

708
00:43:40,061 --> 00:43:41,227
Happily.

709
00:43:42,663 --> 00:43:45,698
Sorry. Gotta run.
Oh, well...

710
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:47,934
You'll tell Galvez?

711
00:43:47,968 --> 00:43:49,969
And you'll sit tight.

712
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:56,308
So?

713
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,343
I slept.

714
00:43:58,377 --> 00:43:59,811
Hey.

715
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:02,113
Let's get you a square meal.

716
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:03,715
Yeah, yeah, come on.
I'll make you one

717
00:44:03,749 --> 00:44:05,517
of my world-famous
sandwiches, huh?

718
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:07,519
(chuckling)

719
00:44:35,414 --> 00:44:36,915
Morning!

720
00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:38,717
Ha!

721
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:40,985
Serves you right.

722
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:43,320
You're supposed to be packing,

723
00:44:43,355 --> 00:44:44,521
not unpacking.

724
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,056
What is it?

725
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:48,726
I told you, something for Mom.

726
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,661
Really? You got her
something at the drugstore?

727
00:44:50,695 --> 00:44:53,397
Yeah, I did.

728
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:54,899
Really.

729
00:44:56,434 --> 00:44:58,569
JESSICA:
You two ready?

730
00:44:58,603 --> 00:45:01,004
Yeah. Shh.
Yeah, we're ready!

731
00:45:05,743 --> 00:45:07,843
Thanks. All right.

732
00:45:13,383 --> 00:45:15,050
You're supposed to help me with this.

733
00:45:15,084 --> 00:45:16,284
Why?

734
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,619
To exercise your mind.
But not tax it.

735
00:45:18,654 --> 00:45:20,187
I have to go to work.

736
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:22,089
No way.

737
00:45:22,123 --> 00:45:23,757
I'm okay!

738
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:26,960
I may have a major situation
that I know how to fix.

739
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:28,461
I know how to stop it.

740
00:45:28,495 --> 00:45:29,729
Feels good out there, doesn't it?

741
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,130
Like you're the Queen of the world.

742
00:45:31,165 --> 00:45:32,364
Yes! Exactly!

743
00:45:32,399 --> 00:45:34,733
But you're not, Carrie.

744
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:39,204
Okay, I just have to make a call.

745
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:40,639
To who?

746
00:45:40,673 --> 00:45:44,376
There's this guy I know.
He's a POW.

747
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,812
He knows how to fill in
this blank, this-this gap

748
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:49,081
because he was there
at that exact time.

749
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:50,650
So tell Saul to call him.

750
00:45:50,684 --> 00:45:52,952
No, it-it, it has to be me.

751
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:54,887
He only told me.

752
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:56,422
Your sister said no calls.

753
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:57,757
No, I have to, Dad.

754
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:58,758
Hey, look!

755
00:45:58,793 --> 00:46:00,293
You're only one day out.

756
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:01,994
Hey, when I'm there,
I'm just like you.

757
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:04,397
You know, lots of gut feelings,
things that I have to do.

758
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,766
But there's good gut,
and then there's bad.

759
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,668
Yeah?
Well, sometimes I think I need

760
00:46:08,702 --> 00:46:11,337
to empty my refrigerator
and set it on fire, you know?

761
00:46:11,371 --> 00:46:13,071
That's what my gut says.

762
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:15,140
It's bad gut.

763
00:46:15,174 --> 00:46:16,675
And if I wait a while,

764
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:19,844
I realize it.

765
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,851
No, this is right.
This is right, I know it.

766
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:27,253
No, Carrie, come on!

767
00:46:27,287 --> 00:46:28,822
Hey, come on! Come on!

768
00:46:28,856 --> 00:46:31,591
I got the corners together.
You can help me with the sides.

769
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:33,594
Carrie!
(door closes)

770
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:35,763
Ah, shit!

771
00:46:53,315 --> 00:46:56,816
Oh, gee, I wonder who leaked our ETA.

772
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:00,619
Maybe he spent the entire
weekend here waiting for me.

773
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:02,221
Ever think about that?

774
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:13,632
It's good to be home.

775
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:14,900
What? Yeah.

776
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:17,069
Yeah, it is.

777
00:47:27,613 --> 00:47:29,246
(cell phone rings)

778
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,984
Oh, it's already started.

779
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,419
Chris, help your mom with the bags.

780
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,223
Hello.

781
00:47:40,257 --> 00:47:41,424
It's Carrie.

782
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:43,059
I know.

783
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,694
(panting):
Okay.

784
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:48,932
I'm calling you, not because of
me and not because of you.

785
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:51,267
I'm not calling to try to...

786
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:54,839
I-I... I'm just calling
about Abu Nazir.

787
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:57,041
What?

788
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:58,709
Let me be more clear.

789
00:47:58,744 --> 00:48:03,581
Okay. We have been alerted
that something is coming.

790
00:48:03,615 --> 00:48:06,084
Something is gonna happen imminently,

791
00:48:06,118 --> 00:48:07,918
and it all has to do

792
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:12,289
with a certain period in Abu
Nazir's life, the fallow yellow

793
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:13,790
if you want to be precise.

794
00:48:13,825 --> 00:48:14,858
I don't understand.

795
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,194
Okay, you were with him then.

796
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:18,928
You have insight.

797
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:23,133
You can identify the impetus,
the incident, the injury.

798
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:24,468
(sighs)

799
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:28,439
Something happened to him, a tragedy.

800
00:48:28,474 --> 00:48:29,975
Carrie, are you okay?

801
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:33,645
You loved him! You told me
that you loved him,

802
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,081
so you must know.

803
00:48:41,654 --> 00:48:45,090
Look, uh, would it help if we met?

804
00:48:45,124 --> 00:48:48,560
Yes! Yeah, okay. Good.

805
00:48:48,594 --> 00:48:50,161
Are you at Langley?

806
00:48:50,196 --> 00:48:51,830
No, no, I'm home.

807
00:48:51,864 --> 00:48:53,798
Stay there.

808
00:48:53,832 --> 00:48:55,733
Okay.

809
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,310
XANDER:
What's that?

810
00:49:06,344 --> 00:49:08,279
It's called Little Round Top.

811
00:49:08,313 --> 00:49:12,116
It's this place where
this teacher from Maine

812
00:49:12,151 --> 00:49:14,618
named Joshua Chamberlain
saved the Union.

813
00:49:14,653 --> 00:49:16,521
I don't see what's so weird about it.

814
00:49:16,555 --> 00:49:18,289
Well, it's not the weird part.

815
00:49:18,323 --> 00:49:22,260
Okay, here it is.

816
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:24,463
Now it's just your dad.

817
00:49:24,497 --> 00:49:25,831
I know.

818
00:49:25,865 --> 00:49:28,300
So what's, what's weird about it?

819
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:32,672
He was just strange all weekend,

820
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:35,041
or at least it seemed like it to me.

821
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:39,913
I mean, he said everything
was fine, but look at this.

822
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:50,691
He just... stands there.

823
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,301
You're right.

824
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:03,237
That is totally weird.

825
00:50:22,026 --> 00:50:24,293
(panting, mutters)

826
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,424
Okay.

827
00:51:13,646 --> 00:51:15,080
(doorbell rings)

828
00:51:17,483 --> 00:51:19,318
MAGGIE:
Who's that?

829
00:51:19,352 --> 00:51:21,252
It's a friend.

830
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,896
David.

831
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,597
Sergeant Brody called me.

832
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,566
What?

833
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,635
He told me everything.

834
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,972
I-I don't know what you mean.

835
00:51:40,006 --> 00:51:41,941
I think you do.

836
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:44,477
Come on. Let's go inside.
What?

837
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,711
Come on.

838
00:51:49,283 --> 00:51:50,416
Ma'am, sir.

839
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:52,786
FRANK:
Excuse me.

840
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,189
He admitted to being complicit
in some kind of fling with you.

841
00:51:56,223 --> 00:51:59,459
But illegal surveillance, Carrie?

842
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:00,660
The continuing harassment?

843
00:52:00,695 --> 00:52:03,096
No! That-that is
a mischaracterization.

844
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:05,999
Your office at Langley's
being cleared as we speak.

845
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:07,601
These gentlemen are
here to do the same.

846
00:52:07,635 --> 00:52:09,670
What? No! No!

847
00:52:09,705 --> 00:52:11,272
Carrie, Carrie...

848
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:20,816
Are those classified documents?

849
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,818
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

850
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:26,688
No, David, that chart is
very important!

851
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:28,189
It is very meaningful!

852
00:52:30,258 --> 00:52:31,659
What is wrong with her?

853
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:33,160
No, don't. Don't tell him.

854
00:52:33,195 --> 00:52:35,663
David...

855
00:52:35,697 --> 00:52:39,667
I am about to solve
this fucking thing!

856
00:52:46,548 --> 00:52:47,808
Strip it.

857
00:52:47,843 --> 00:52:50,545
No, no, no, no, no! Please, please!
MAGGIE: Carrie, no, come on.

858
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:52,881
We need to sit down right now.
Come with me. I'm serious!

859
00:52:52,915 --> 00:52:56,184
- We're gonna sit down right... - Please, just
let me hold onto it for a little while...

860
00:52:56,218 --> 00:52:57,919
ESTES: How long has she
been like this?

861
00:52:57,953 --> 00:53:00,488
No! You don't... you don't know
what you're doing!

862
00:53:00,523 --> 00:53:02,891
Carrie?
You don't know what you're doing!

863
00:53:02,925 --> 00:53:04,326
We're just gonna...
No!

864
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,163
David, this isn't...!

865
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:10,767
(overlapping shouts)

866
00:53:20,523 --> 00:53:31,122
