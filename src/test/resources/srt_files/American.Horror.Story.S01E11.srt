1
00:00:01,878 --> 00:00:03,352
Just keep it
and not play anymore?

2
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:05,784
No.
Explain that one.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,252
You always give a guy a second chance.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,050
That's, like, the golden rule of guys.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,351
Then what's the problem?

6
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:13,126
The problem is I can't let him know

7
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:14,528
I'm letting you in the back.

8
00:00:14,596 --> 00:00:17,034
Look, Joanna, you can go ahead
and make fun of this,

9
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:19,103
but this is real important.

10
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:22,041
I mean, I'm telling you
what guys think, and if you want

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,377
to be one of the guys,
you don't break the code.

12
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:29,485
It's no picnic.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

14
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,542
Ha!

15
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,549
No, Thaddeus, go away!

16
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:02,024
Shh...

17
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,393
Tell me, what's your name?

18
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,161
T-Tate.

19
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,431
If Thaddeus comes back
to scare you again,

20
00:02:09,499 --> 00:02:13,702
Just shut your eyes
and say, "Go away."

21
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:15,905
You understand, Tate?

22
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:17,907
He'll mind you

23
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:20,010
'cause I'm going to protect you.

24
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:25,749
I wish you were my mommy.

25
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:26,750
Hmm.

26
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,755
Now dry your tears, child.

27
00:02:34,894 --> 00:02:37,662
Life is too short for so much sorrow.

28
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:10,965
Who are you?

29
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,500
It's me, Tate.

30
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:16,871
"Life's too short
for so much sorrow."

31
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:18,640
You're wrong.

32
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,142
It's an eternity.

33
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,980
Just endless days
and nights of longing;

34
00:03:24,047 --> 00:03:26,516
where's my baby?

35
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:30,587
That's what I want to talk
to you about.

36
00:03:30,655 --> 00:03:32,623
You, you promised me.

37
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,692
You made one with her,
the-the lady of the house.

38
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,827
Vivien.

39
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:39,297
That's Violet's mother.

40
00:03:39,364 --> 00:03:40,898
And I can't give you
that baby anymore.

41
00:03:40,965 --> 00:03:42,332
Everything's changed, Nora.

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,269
I'm in love with Violet.

43
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:46,537
I see.

44
00:03:46,604 --> 00:03:49,373
I just can't take her brother away.

45
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,575
But I can.

46
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:52,542
And I will.

47
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,682
That baby is mine.

48

49
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,346
Dad, I'm not a dog! I told you I don't feel well!
Just leave me here!

50
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,401
No, I don't trust you anymore
and I don't trust Tate!

51
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:09,203
Tate? I haven't
seen him in weeks!

52
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,571
No more, Violet.
Your mom's coming home

53
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,836
and you're coming with me to get her.

54
00:05:11,956 --> 00:05:13,114
Dad, please, I don't feel well!

55
00:05:13,138 --> 00:05:14,350
You can lay down in the car.

56
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,554
And when you get home,
pack up your things.

57
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:16,702
We're leaving this house for good.

58
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:18,118
What? You guys are
back together?

59
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,553
I don't know yet--
your mom wants

60
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,388
to go to Aunt Jo's to give birth,

61
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:23,618
and I'm supporting it.
No, you don't want to do this.

62
00:05:23,738 --> 00:05:25,371
Violet, your mother's been locked up

63
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:27,440
in a psych ward for weeks.

64
00:05:27,508 --> 00:05:29,576
I won't let her stay
there for another minute.

65
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:33,847
Are you gonna get in the car
or do I have to make you?

66
00:05:33,915 --> 00:05:35,649
My God, Violet,
what is wrong with you?!

67
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:38,384
Get in the car!
Your mother wants to see you!

68
00:05:38,452 --> 00:05:40,586
I'm gonna throw up!

69
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:42,455
Fine. I'll lay down.

70
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,614
What's gonna happen
when they get back?

71
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:11,416
What do I say?

72
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:20,059
It's not UTube with a U.
It's YouTube.

73
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,693
Y-O-U.

74
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,062
Oh.

75
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,831
If they find out I killed myself,

76
00:06:25,898 --> 00:06:27,632
they'll go insane.

77
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,002
Literally, for real this time.

78
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:31,069
They can't know.

79
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,305
Well, you can't control it forever.

80
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:37,409
I mean, it is what it is, Violet.

81
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,811
One of these days, this
computer will be obsolete.

82
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,047
People will have microchips implanted

83
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:43,282
in their brains or something.

84
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,684
We won't be able to watch
YouTube or anything.

85
00:06:45,752 --> 00:06:48,687
We'll be like all the others here;

86
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,922
prisoners in a windowless cell.

87
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,625
Who's gonna show me
the new ways of the world?

88
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,694
Nobody here is happy, Tate.

89
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:58,229
Well, yeah, but they're not like us.

90
00:06:58,296 --> 00:06:59,229
They're lonely.

91
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:02,032
We have each other.

92
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,567
We'll never have kids.

93
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,183
I was so worried when Madame

94
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,685
didn't have any potatoes,

95
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:25,555
but I have to say these yams
are making a cleaner image.

96
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:27,724
Less moisture, I think.

97
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:29,560
I love that Chinese red.

98
00:07:29,628 --> 00:07:31,929
I always meant to use it in
the powder room downstairs.

99
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:33,531
I'm gonna paint those old cribs, too.

100
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,700
Really? Red cribs?

101
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,668
Uh, Chad...

102
00:07:37,736 --> 00:07:40,571
what did we talk about?

103
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:45,176
"Our" babies, not "my" babies.

104
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,912
You know what?
I can live with a red crib.

105
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,082
It might actually be kind of fabulous.

106
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:53,085
You are so adorable when you're happy.

107
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,061
Who asked you to decorate the nursery?

108
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:03,330
Let me break it down for you,
sweetheart.

109
00:08:03,398 --> 00:08:05,032
This is our house

110
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,201
and we're having twins.

111
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:09,905
Who's your surrogate, one of
those nurses in my basement?

112
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:13,375
No... no.

113
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:17,547
A very, very human surrogate, Elvira.

114
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:20,015
Your lovely mother.

115
00:08:21,785 --> 00:08:23,786
You think you're gonna steal
those twins?

116
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:25,587
You pathetic homos couldn't steal

117
00:08:25,655 --> 00:08:27,722
the shit out of your own ass!

118
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:30,791
You know what?

119
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:32,393
It doesn't matter.

120
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:34,929
As soon as my parents get back,
we're leaving here.

121
00:08:34,996 --> 00:08:36,597
They're leaving.

122
00:08:36,665 --> 00:08:38,900
So knock yourselves out.

123
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,169
Honey, your parents
aren't going anywhere

124
00:08:41,236 --> 00:08:42,804
as long as you're stuck here.

125
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,606
And don't you get
all snotty, little sister.

126
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:46,041
You'll be begging to babysit.

127
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,210
As big as this place is,
it does get very, very lonely.

128
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,813
It could get ugly, though.

129
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,482
Were you a C-section?

130
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,352
Is there an existing zipper
we might use?

131
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,253
Watch it, you goddamn queen.

132
00:08:56,321 --> 00:09:00,858
Oh, I am quaking in my loafers.

133
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,293
What are you gonna do...

134
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,429
murder me?

135
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,712
My brown Betty turns
to black Betty in 20 minutes.

136
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,481
So tell me what this is all about.

137
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:26,049
I need help.

138
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:29,052
Do you know those two guys
that lived here before us?

139
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,854
Frick and Frack?

140
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:32,122
How could I forget?

141
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,524
Well, they're upstairs and they're

142
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:34,926
planning to kidnap my mother's babies

143
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:38,529
and raise them themselves.

144
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:44,135
Well, let me assure you
that is never going to happen.

145
00:09:44,202 --> 00:09:45,936
My mom's on her way back
from the hospital today.

146
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,772
And I don't trust them.

147
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,440
I called 'cause
I want to talk to that woman,

148
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:50,674
the Craig's List psychic.

149
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:54,144
Billie Dean? About what?

150
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:55,946
Getting rid of ghosts.
There must be a way.

151
00:09:58,883 --> 00:10:00,884
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

152
00:10:02,553 --> 00:10:05,722
Chad? Chad...?

153
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,757
Come out, come out wherever you are.

154
00:10:20,739 --> 00:10:22,173
Put your skanky claw on that crib,

155
00:10:22,241 --> 00:10:23,541
you'll be pulling away a bloody stump.

156
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:27,980
Where did you find these things?

157
00:10:28,048 --> 00:10:28,981
Around.

158
00:10:29,049 --> 00:10:31,651
You'd be amazed

159
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,419
at the little forgotten
treasures left behind

160
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:34,721
by previous occupants.

161
00:10:34,788 --> 00:10:38,691
What you are planning to do
is unnatural.

162
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,227
Deodorant's unnatural,
but it's a public good.

163
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:45,030
We'll make excellent parents.

164
00:10:45,097 --> 00:10:46,798
Man shall not lie with man.

165
00:10:46,866 --> 00:10:48,600
It is an abomination.

166
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:52,337
So's that hairdo, but I figure
that's your business.

167
00:10:52,404 --> 00:10:54,305
Why can't you people just
content yourself

168
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:55,773
with having pets?

169
00:10:55,841 --> 00:11:01,046
Why must you subject an innocent
child to your perversions?

170
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:02,915
There's nothing in the studies
that indicates being raised

171
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:05,952
by a same-sex couple has any
ill effects on children.

172
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,254
I assume the same applies
to the formerly living.

173
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:11,325
Well, the only study I know
is the study of blood and pain.

174
00:11:11,393 --> 00:11:14,028
My children came out of my body,
and that is something

175
00:11:14,096 --> 00:11:16,131
that you will never
be able to understand.

176
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:20,502
Lady, just because you happen to be

177
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:22,437
the hole they crawled out of

178
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:24,139
doesn't mean a goddamn thing.

179
00:11:24,207 --> 00:11:25,407
It means everything.

180
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:27,475
Right. Sure.

181
00:11:27,543 --> 00:11:29,744
That's why I can't even walk
through my own home

182
00:11:29,812 --> 00:11:31,446
without tripping over one
of your dead offspring.

183
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:34,616
I loved my children.

184
00:11:34,684 --> 00:11:36,051
To death.

185
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:37,719
They are a part of me,

186
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:40,856
just like that unborn child
is a part of me,

187
00:11:40,923 --> 00:11:42,591
and I will not have you

188
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,993
put your filthy hands
on my grandchild.

189
00:11:47,129 --> 00:11:48,496
Grandchild?

190
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:51,365
Wait a minute.

191
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,334
Are you telling me
that Norman Bates Jr.

192
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:54,835
is the baby daddy?

193
00:11:56,938 --> 00:12:00,373
You gotta love this house.

194
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:01,374
Listen to me.

195
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:02,576
You can have the other one.

196
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:04,311
The one fathered by Dr. Harmon.

197
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,913
I mean, he's an attractive man.

198
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:09,749
But not my grandbaby.

199
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:12,451
A blond and a brunette--
just like me and Pat.

200
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:15,321
It's perfect.

201
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,723
No.

202
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,692
We definitely need both.

203
00:12:21,061 --> 00:12:23,196
God, you're vile.

204
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:26,032
You're not suited to raise children.

205
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,467
Raise them?

206
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:29,769
Oh, honey, no, no, no.

207
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:31,872
We're going to wait until
they reach that perfect,

208
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,476
adorable age-- around a year,
year and a half or so--

209
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:37,111
and then we're going to smother them

210
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,146
with hypoallergenic pillows.

211
00:12:39,214 --> 00:12:42,182
That way, they'll be cute forever.

212
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:01,363
So much pain here.

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,869
So much longing and regret.

214
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:11,772
Fear.

215
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,409
Sadness.

216
00:13:16,711 --> 00:13:18,746
Guilt.

217
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,443
And perversion.

218
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:24,685
Now, can you ferret out
the fairies for us?

219
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:27,821
I mean, that's our main
concern at the moment.

220
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:29,389
Targeting a particular spirit

221
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:31,792
is going to be difficult.

222
00:13:32,527 --> 00:13:34,761
This is a very crowded house.

223
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:36,863
<i>You were so young.</i>

224
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,798
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

225
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,066
<i>Oh, God.</i>

226
00:13:40,134 --> 00:13:41,200
<i>Please don't tell.</i>

227
00:13:41,268 --> 00:13:43,369
<i>They can't know.</i>

228
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:44,604
So what can we do?

229
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:47,506
Somehow, we have to try
and dislodge them

230
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:50,943
from the paramagnetic grip
of this place.

231
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,477
The what?

232
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:54,979
The evil.

233
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:58,650
It's a force
just like any other, Violet.

234
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,586
Pure physics.

235
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,855
Real and powerful.

236
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:04,256
Created by events.

237
00:14:04,324 --> 00:14:07,293
Events that unleash psychic energy

238
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:10,496
into the environment,
where it's absorbed.

239
00:14:10,564 --> 00:14:13,099
Like the way a battery stores energy.

240
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,569
You'll see it all the time

241
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:19,239
in places like prisons or asylums.

242
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:22,909
Negative energy feeds
on trauma and pain.

243
00:14:24,312 --> 00:14:25,846
It draws those things to it.

244
00:14:27,315 --> 00:14:30,583
The force here in this house is larger

245
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:32,585
than the many individual traumas.

246
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,187
And it has a need.

247
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:38,024
It wants to break through.

248
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:40,793
It wants to move in our world.

249
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,963
It's using those trapped

250
00:14:43,031 --> 00:14:46,500
between this world and the next
as conduits.

251
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:47,869
That's very interesting.

252
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,473
But what do we do about the gays?

253
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,041
I mean, how do we get rid of them?

254
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:54,543
Oh, there might be a way.

255
00:14:54,611 --> 00:14:56,479
I can't promise...

256
00:14:58,181 --> 00:15:00,182
He can't be here.

257
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,784
Tate.

258
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,386
Billie Dean,

259
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:05,821
that's my boy.

260
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,593
That's Tate.

261
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,094
I want to help.

262
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,529
You've helped enough.

263
00:15:13,597 --> 00:15:15,431
Not now, Tate.

264
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:17,967
Go on.

265
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,408
What was that about?

266
00:15:26,644 --> 00:15:27,778
It's just that,

267
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:29,447
sometimes, when a medium

268
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,382
meets a spirit so directly,

269
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,017
it has a powerful effect.

270
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:34,285
That's all.

271
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:36,588
It's nothing to concern
yourself about.

272
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:38,690
Okay, so what can we do?

273
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:43,228
Why didn't Violet come?

274
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:46,631
Violet's been
having a very rough time.

275
00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,068
She didn't come visit me once, Ben.

276
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:53,839
I'm Dr. Marchesi,
the resident physician.

277
00:15:53,907 --> 00:15:54,941
How are you, Vivien?

278
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:56,976
Fine. Ready to go home.

279
00:15:57,044 --> 00:15:59,045
Have you had any luck
convincing your wife

280
00:15:59,112 --> 00:16:01,414
to push off the trip
until after the birth?

281
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,549
Dr. Marchesi is
recommending bed rest

282
00:16:03,617 --> 00:16:05,051
because of the twins,

283
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,352
which I wholeheartedly

284
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,887
agree with.

285
00:16:07,954 --> 00:16:10,556
And I said to him that we would
get a wheelchair at the airport.

286
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:12,725
I will be sitting
the whole way to Florida.

287
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:14,326
And I'm only six months pregnant,

288
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:16,061
so it's still okay to travel.
I'll be fine.

289
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:17,930
All right, well, wheelchairs

290
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:19,065
are all well and good,

291
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:20,533
but as I told your wife,

292
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,701
I wouldn't be surprised
if your obstetrician

293
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,271
didn't recommend an immediate
emergency C-section.

294
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:27,473
Well, in 24 hours,
I will be in the capable hands

295
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,877
of my sister and her family

296
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:31,812
and an excellent obstetrician.

297
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,747
I'll be with people who I trust,

298
00:16:33,815 --> 00:16:35,049
and out of this city.

299
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,151
Thank you for bringing these.

300
00:16:37,218 --> 00:16:38,986
I'll bring them to the doctor.

301
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:41,054
I'd like to hear it from the doctor.

302
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:42,823
Emergency C-section?

303
00:16:42,891 --> 00:16:46,360
I'm sure you're
aware that these babies--

304
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:47,861
well, rather,
one of these babies--

305
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:49,596
has been developing at a rapid rate.

306
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:51,432
I mean, to the point

307
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,634
where he's ready to come out
and live on his own.

308
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:56,403
And the other one seems
to be getting weaker.

309
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,873
Sometimes referred to as
intrauterine omophagia.

310
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,475
All the necessary nutrients

311
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,977
are being devoured
by the larger fetus.

312
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:05,347
The alpha, if you will.

313
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:07,115
When were you
going to tell me this, Vivien?

314
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:09,485
We will address it all
when we get to Florida.

315
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:12,622
Well, I'm on record.

316
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:15,292
It was nice to meet you,
Dr. Harmon, Vivien.

317
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,094
If I were you, I would
start checking to see

318
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,330
if there's a medical doctor
on that flight.

319
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:26,936
Let's go.

320
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:32,341
It's difficult to banish a spirit,

321
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:33,776
but not impossible.

322
00:17:35,945 --> 00:17:37,813
The most successful
attempt that I know of

323
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,147
happened when America was known

324
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:40,349
as the New World.

325
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:41,350
Are you kidding?

326
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:42,685
That's like 500 years ago.

327
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:44,988
Spirits do not follow
our physical laws.

328
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:47,391
Nor are they affected by time.

329
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:49,059
About the only thing
they have in common

330
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:50,461
with the living is their suffering.

331
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:52,964
Regret.

332
00:17:53,032 --> 00:17:54,766
Pain.

333
00:17:54,834 --> 00:17:56,802
Loneliness.

334
00:17:56,869 --> 00:17:59,004
In 1590,

335
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:01,806
<i>on the coast of what we</i>
<i>now know as North Carolina,</i>

336
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:04,810
<i>the entire colony of Roanoke--</i>

337
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:08,514
<i>all 117 men, women</i>
<i>and children--</i>

338
00:18:08,582 --> 00:18:10,683
<i>died inexplicably.</i>

339
00:18:10,751 --> 00:18:13,018
It became known as the Ghost Colony

340
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:14,753
because the spirits remained.

341
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,523
<i>They haunted the native tribes</i>
<i>living in the surrounding area.</i>

342
00:18:20,226 --> 00:18:22,326
<i>Killing indiscriminately.</i>

343
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,501
The elder knew he had to act.

344
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:31,036
He cast a banishment curse.

345
00:18:31,103 --> 00:18:34,239
<i>First, he collected</i>
<i>the personal belongings</i>

346
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:36,208
<i>of all the dead colonists.</i>

347
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:38,844
<i>Then they burned them.</i>

348
00:18:38,912 --> 00:18:43,382
<i>The ghosts appeared,</i>
<i>summoned by their talismans.</i>

349
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:46,485
<i>But before the spirits</i>
<i>could cause them any more harm,</i>

350
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:49,021
<i>the elder</i> <i>completed the curse</i>

351
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:51,589
<i>that would banish</i> <i>the ghosts forever.</i>

352
00:18:51,657 --> 00:18:53,625
<i>How?</i>

353
00:18:53,693 --> 00:18:55,827
<i>By uttering a single word.</i>

354
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:58,129
<i>The same word found</i> <i>carved on a post</i>

355
00:18:58,197 --> 00:19:00,131
<i>at the abandoned colony.</i>

356
00:19:00,199 --> 00:19:01,733
Croatoan.

357
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,000
Croatoan.

358
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,504
So now you know what you have to do.

359
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,551
What did she say?

360
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,086
We have to get something of his.

361
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:24,188
Something important.

362
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:25,222
Like an heirloom or a ring.

363
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,191
Like a talisman.

364
00:19:28,258 --> 00:19:31,494
If we have the talisman
and we do this special ritual,

365
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:32,629
he'll be gone.

366
00:19:32,696 --> 00:19:33,897
That sounds like bullshit.

367
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,966
Billie Dean's for real.
She studies this stuff.

368
00:19:36,034 --> 00:19:37,267
The bigger guy, he wears a ring.

369
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,002
It's like a wedding ring,
but I can't remember

370
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,871
which hand it's on.
I don't trust her!

371
00:19:40,938 --> 00:19:42,940
Now, why'd she say
all that stuff about me?

372
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,577
I did something bad, didn't I?

373
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,545
Let's just get the ring.

374
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:55,784
How does it work?

375
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:58,387
Will the kid call you both daddy,

376
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:00,589
or is one of you the mom?

377
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,258
I'm just messing with you.

378
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,727
Seriously, though,

379
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:06,797
are you ready for all this?

380
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:09,567
I mean, you never struck me
as the diapers

381
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:11,302
and midnight feedings type.

382
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,772
Maybe you should have taken
a few minutes to get to know me

383
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,274
before you stuck
a fireplace poker up my ass.

384
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,544
Fair enough.

385
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:20,813
Look.

386
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,915
We're all going to be here
for a long time, so...

387
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:26,952
maybe we can figure out a way
to let bygones be bygones

388
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,221
and, you know, cohabitate.

389
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:31,157
I'm dead because of you!

390
00:20:31,224 --> 00:20:32,391
Well, there's got to be

391
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:34,093
something I could offer you.

392
00:20:34,161 --> 00:20:36,061
I mean, just because we're dead

393
00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:37,663
doesn't mean we don't have wants.

394
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:41,534
Desires.

395
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:46,606
Marriage looks hard.

396
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:48,675
Especially to that guy.

397
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:50,710
Always on you all the time.

398
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:52,646
And never in the ways you want, right?

399
00:20:54,749 --> 00:20:56,049
It must suck

400
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:59,787
to have to wait till
Halloween every year

401
00:20:59,854 --> 00:21:02,656
to get a little strange.

402
00:21:10,765 --> 00:21:11,832
I can't kill you,

403
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,067
but I can make you suffer!

404
00:21:14,302 --> 00:21:16,403
Best part is, when I'm done,

405
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:17,738
you'll heal up and I can beat

406
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:20,407
the shit out of you all over again!

407
00:21:20,475 --> 00:21:21,775
Harder!

408
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:24,979
I like it rough.
Not supposed to be like this!

409
00:21:25,047 --> 00:21:27,381
I'm not supposed to be here!

410
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:29,050
Look at me.
Look at me!

411
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:31,352
I was going to get out!

412
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:37,892
I fell in love.
God help me, I was going

413
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,794
to get out and be with him,
and then you killed me,

414
00:21:39,862 --> 00:21:42,196
and now I'm stuck here...

415
00:21:42,264 --> 00:21:44,298
with him!

416
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,333
Chad.

417
00:21:59,578 --> 00:22:01,546
I won't go in the house.

418
00:22:01,614 --> 00:22:02,880
You don't have to.

419
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,182
I packed your things.

420
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:05,216
Is Violet packed?

421
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:07,218
I told her we're leaving.

422
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:11,056
Okay?

423
00:22:55,102 --> 00:22:55,969
What'd you get?

424
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:58,238
He took it off to paint.

425
00:22:58,306 --> 00:23:00,240
Why does a ghost need a watch?

426
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:01,508
Violet!

427
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:03,878
Violet!

428
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:06,247
You disappeared on me!
What the hell happened?!

429
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:09,284
Violet, your mom's waiting in the car.

430
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:11,053
We have a plane to catch.

431
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,388
Good. Go far away.

432
00:23:13,456 --> 00:23:15,291
Just don't bring mom in the house.

433
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,593
- What are you talking about?
You're coming with us. - No!

434
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:18,927
I can take care of myself.

435
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:20,762
And if you want to,
you can come back for me later.

436
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,197
But for right now,
you just have to trust me

437
00:23:22,265 --> 00:23:23,498
and get the hell out of here.

438
00:23:23,566 --> 00:23:26,134
Tell mom I love her
and good luck with the babies.

439
00:23:26,202 --> 00:23:27,669
What's the matter
with you? Huh?

440
00:23:27,737 --> 00:23:28,937
Are you high or something?

441
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:30,938
I wish.

442
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:32,473
Violet, I stopped at a red
light and you were gone.

443
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,374
Where did you go?
Nowhere.

444
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:34,875
I was right here.

445
00:23:34,943 --> 00:23:36,410
I wanted to come.

446
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:37,878
I swear.

447
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:39,280
I couldn't leave the house.

448
00:23:39,347 --> 00:23:40,347
Stop it!
You're lying.

449
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:41,816
You're on drugs, I can tell.

450
00:23:41,884 --> 00:23:43,184
Tell me what kind, right now.

451
00:23:43,252 --> 00:23:45,387
Tell me!

452
00:23:45,454 --> 00:23:47,389
I'm dead!

453
00:23:47,457 --> 00:23:48,858
Don't you get it?

454
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:52,561
When you die in this house,
you don't get to leave.

455
00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:56,165
That's why you need to go,
and take mom somewhere safe.

456
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:57,333
Ben!

457
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,468
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

458
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:00,537
You're coming with me.

459
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,047
Vivien!

460
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,849
Oh, Vivien, is-is
the baby coming?

461
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,016
No!

462
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,751
No, it's too soon!

463
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:16,420
No, no, no!

464
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:17,855
No, honey.

465
00:24:17,922 --> 00:24:20,458
When a child is ready to be
born, there's no stopping it.

466
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,326
No!
Come on, we got to get you to the house.

467
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,327
No!

468
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:26,798
I took some pills.

469
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,566
I didn't mean to kill myself.

470
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,701
Ben!

471
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:35,340
What's wrong?!

472
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:36,942
The babies are coming.

473
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,911
No! No!

474
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:41,046
No!

475
00:24:48,691 --> 00:24:49,445
Take it easy, now.

476
00:24:49,565 --> 00:24:51,590
Don't forget to
breathe. Breathe.

477
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,020
I can't get any service.

478
00:24:53,088 --> 00:24:55,222
I got to go to the hospital now!

479
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,291
It's too late for that;
you're already crowning.

480
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:59,226
I'm gonna call Dr. Hall. We'll
get you an ambulance right away.

481
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:01,027
Breathe, Vivien, breathe.

482
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:02,273
Oh, God! It hurts.

483
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:03,564
Well, of course it does, honey.

484
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:04,732
That's a woman's curse.

485
00:25:10,591 --> 00:25:12,425
She can't give birth here.

486
00:25:12,493 --> 00:25:13,759
It's not safe.

487
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:15,427
Well, then make it safe.
You know what to do.

488
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:19,067
Damn it.

489
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:27,139
Shit!

490
00:25:30,456 --> 00:25:32,226
Hey!

491
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,397
Get away from there!

492
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,434
You kids get away from there!

493
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:53,502
Dr. Harmon.

494
00:25:56,306 --> 00:25:59,174
It's time.

495
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,147
Nurse, bring me my doctor bag.

496
00:26:07,215 --> 00:26:08,581
<i>This is wrong.</i>

497
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,150
Find me the 12-gauge scalpel.

498
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:14,487
<i>We have to get you out of here.</i>

499
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:19,392
Where are those towels?

500
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,594
Spread them out underneath her.

501
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,139
<i>This house.</i>

502
00:26:31,207 --> 00:26:32,674
<i>This house!</i>

503
00:26:35,144 --> 00:26:36,044
Ben?!

504
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:37,479
Wake up.

505
00:26:37,547 --> 00:26:38,947
This house is trying to help.

506
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:41,549
And right now, you are in
no position to refuse.

507
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:42,984
Your wife needs you.

508
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,386
So you better pull yourself
together and get in there.

509
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:47,254
For her.

510
00:26:47,322 --> 00:26:48,588
Ben?!

511
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,397
Who are all these people?

512
00:26:57,465 --> 00:26:59,333
<i>Who are these people?!</i>

513
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,201
It's okay, baby.

514
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:03,938
They're here to help us.

515
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,673
I forgot how painful this is.

516
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:09,344
Do you have a little something
for her, Doctor?

517
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:11,580
Ether.

518
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:13,448
Just to take the edge off.

519
00:27:26,494 --> 00:27:28,829
<i>Help.</i>

520
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:32,399
Oh, I feel another one coming.

521
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:36,369
Okay, honey, remember your breathing.

522
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:42,209
You're doing great.
You're doing great.

523
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:43,410
Just hang in there, honey.

524
00:27:43,478 --> 00:27:44,545
You're doing great.

525
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,282
Here we go.
One more push.

526
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,060
Just breathe, honey.

527
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,129
Breathe.
Remember your breathing.

528
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,334
Breathe.

529
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:08,369
Breathe.
I hate you.

530
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,838
I love you.

531
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:11,773
Push, push, push!
One more!

532
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,511
Here we go.
One more push.

533
00:28:17,578 --> 00:28:18,879
One more big push.
Here she comes. Come on, push!

534
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:19,980
Come on, honey, push!

535
00:28:20,048 --> 00:28:20,981
Push!
Push, honey!

536
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:22,616
God, I love you.

537
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:28,253
Breathe.

538
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:29,821
I never wanted to lose you.

539
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:31,023
You never will.

540
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,658
<i>She's coming!</i>

541
00:28:32,725 --> 00:28:34,293
Come on! Push!
Here she comes!

542
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,427
Push!

543
00:28:35,495 --> 00:28:36,762
Come on, honey!

544
00:28:36,829 --> 00:28:38,631
Push!

545
00:28:41,134 --> 00:28:42,401
It's a healthy baby girl.

546
00:28:42,468 --> 00:28:43,969
Daddy, you want to cut the cord?

547
00:28:47,373 --> 00:28:49,207
Oh, my God.

548
00:28:50,543 --> 00:28:51,676
Oh, my God.

549
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:52,544
Violet.

550
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:00,618
Your baby is stillborn.

551
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:08,359
Is it a boy or a girl?

552
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:14,165
Can I hold it?

553
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:18,469
No.

554
00:29:18,537 --> 00:29:20,805
Not just yet, sweetheart.

555
00:29:20,872 --> 00:29:22,106
You've got another one coming.

556
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,064
What exactly do you think
you're doing, young lady?

557
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:51,533
Is that my $12,000 watch that
you're putting into the furnace?

558
00:29:51,601 --> 00:29:52,867
Croatoan!

559
00:29:54,504 --> 00:29:55,471
Croatoan!

560
00:29:56,573 --> 00:29:57,707
Croatoan!

561
00:30:07,753 --> 00:30:09,754
Just kidding.

562
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,092
So where'd you get that one?

563
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,261
That press-on nail psychic
who was here earlier?

564
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:17,829
I mean, really?

565
00:30:17,897 --> 00:30:18,831
The Roanoke spell?

566
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:20,766
Please, tell me you'll be

567
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,334
slitting the throat of a chicken next,

568
00:30:22,402 --> 00:30:24,769
because I've always
found that very dramatic.

569
00:30:24,837 --> 00:30:27,505
I also quite enjoy
the burning of the sage

570
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:29,473
to rid the house of spirits.

571
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,342
It didn't work.
Of course it didn't work.

572
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,643
It's bullshit.

573
00:30:32,711 --> 00:30:34,044
It's all bullshit.

574
00:30:34,112 --> 00:30:36,847
People make up these spells and chants

575
00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,083
in order to feel like
they're in control.

576
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,318
Well, guess what?

577
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:42,855
They're not.

578
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,957
Never have been.

579
00:30:45,024 --> 00:30:46,993
What are you doing?

580
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:49,362
My own bullshit ritual.

581
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,730
There's not gonna be any nursery.

582
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,603
We're not gonna be parents.

583
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:00,808
Your mother's babies are safe.

584
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,276
From us, at least.

585
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:03,778
I'm doomed to spend eternity

586
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:07,247
with a man who doesn't love me.

587
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,216
Of course, it could be worse.

588
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:13,420
Your man does love you...

589
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,656
but he'll always be a monster.

590
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:16,756
You're wrong.

591
00:31:16,824 --> 00:31:18,057
Tate's changed.

592
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:19,593
He doesn't even remember what he did.

593
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:20,894
Oh?

594
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,696
When did he change?

595
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:23,864
When he murdered me?

596
00:31:23,932 --> 00:31:26,299
When he murdered my boyfriend?

597
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:32,139
Or did he change
when he raped your mother?

598
00:31:32,207 --> 00:31:35,509
What?

599
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:36,977
No, that's a lie.

600
00:31:37,044 --> 00:31:37,878
Is it?

601
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:42,482
I think you're about to find out.

602
00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:52,751
Vivien, breathe.
You have to breathe.

603
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:53,895
Vivien, breathe!

604
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:56,197
You have to breathe!

605
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:58,266
I need forceps, now.
What's happening?

606
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,143
It's dystocia.

607
00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:01,703
I have to manipulate the baby
through the pubic symphysis.

608
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,339
I can't, Ben.

609
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:05,708
I can't do it.

610
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:06,776
You can do it.

611
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,645
I-I promise you.
Look at me.

612
00:32:08,712 --> 00:32:09,579
You can do this.

613
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:13,917
Dr. Harmon, have your wife
stop pushing until I say so.

614
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:15,319
Vivien, can you hear me?

615
00:32:15,386 --> 00:32:17,755
You have to stop pushing
until I tell you.

616
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:24,427
It hurts so much!

617
00:32:24,495 --> 00:32:26,896
Squeeze my hand as hard
as you can! Squeeze!

618
00:32:26,964 --> 00:32:29,732
Get the gauze ready
to stop the bleeding.

619
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,667
Now, Dr. Harmon.
Push, Vivien!

620
00:32:31,734 --> 00:32:34,102
You have to push!
Push!

621
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,037
Push! Push!

622
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:37,571
He's coming.

623
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,073
Push! You're doing great, Viv!

624
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,241
You're doing great, Viv.

625
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,710
Oh, God, it's ripping me apart!

626
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:43,811
Don't stop, angel!

627
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,446
The end is in sight.
I can see him.

628
00:33:00,194 --> 00:33:02,261
You did it, babe.

629
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:03,929
Honey, you did it.

630
00:33:03,997 --> 00:33:05,164
You did it.

631
00:33:16,976 --> 00:33:19,478
- Is everything all right?
- She's bleeding.

632
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:21,814
I have to stop the bleeding.

633
00:33:21,882 --> 00:33:23,816
Cut the cord. It's time
to separate mother and son.

634
00:33:24,985 --> 00:33:27,153
Can I see the baby?

635
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,055
Hand him to me.

636
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:31,057
Oh.

637
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:32,491
Oh.

638
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,427
I'll get him washed up.
I'll bring him right back.

639
00:33:50,878 --> 00:33:53,312
Doctor, is
everything all right?

640
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,545
Oh, what is the matter with you?

641
00:34:24,613 --> 00:34:27,782
He's the most beautiful
baby I've ever seen.

642
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:33,255
From blood and pain come perfection.

643
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:37,025
Hey, bitches.

644
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:39,527
You get all that slime
off my baby yet?

645
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:42,630
Nurse, I need pressure on this.

646
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,232
What the hell
is going on?

647
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:47,769
She's going into shock.
I can't stop the hemorrhaging.

648
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,104
Vivien, stay with me.

649
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,273
Vivien.

650
00:34:52,341 --> 00:34:53,642
Mom...

651
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:57,112
Violet.

652
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,849
I'm sorry I didn't go
see you at the hospital.

653
00:34:59,917 --> 00:35:01,384
I wanted to,

654
00:35:01,452 --> 00:35:03,987
but I couldn't.

655
00:35:04,055 --> 00:35:07,992
- You're here now--
that's all that matters. - Vivien.

656
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,495
Listen to me.

657
00:35:11,563 --> 00:35:14,232
Concentrate on my words.

658
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:18,469
We can be happy, honey.

659
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:21,105
Just like we were before.

660
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:24,575
Before my mistakes, before this house.

661
00:35:24,643 --> 00:35:27,512
It's okay, Mom.

662
00:35:27,579 --> 00:35:29,914
If you're in pain,

663
00:35:29,982 --> 00:35:31,215
let go.

664
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,922
I don't think I have a choice.

665
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:41,760
- Hold on, Vivien.
- Stay with me.

666
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:43,662
Come to this side.

667
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,265
Let go.

668
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:49,402
You can be with me.

669
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,038
Don't die.

670
00:35:51,106 --> 00:35:55,276
Don't die on me, Vivien.

671
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:59,480
We can still have a life together.

672
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,548
We can still be happy.

673
00:36:56,703 --> 00:36:58,170
My mom is dead.

674
00:37:02,943 --> 00:37:04,544
I'm so sorry.

675
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:06,913
I know you were close.

676
00:37:06,981 --> 00:37:11,452
Yeah, we were.

677
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:14,188
My dad's down there all alone now.

678
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:19,360
That makes me sad.

679
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:21,028
I like your dad.

680
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:22,830
He was nice to me.

681
00:37:22,898 --> 00:37:24,532
He's nice to all his patients.

682
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,333
Even the ones who lie to him.
What?

683
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:29,737
Why did you start seeing
him in the first place?

684
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:31,239
Constance thought you needed help.

685
00:37:31,306 --> 00:37:33,041
I did. I do.

686
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:36,177
You knew you were dead.

687
00:37:36,245 --> 00:37:39,246
Yeah.

688
00:37:39,314 --> 00:37:41,115
I knew.

689
00:37:41,183 --> 00:37:42,250
Do you know why?

690
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:45,986
The cops shot me.

691
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:47,288
Right here in this room.

692
00:37:47,356 --> 00:37:50,524
Why? Why did they shoot you?

693
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:54,695
I don't know.

694
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:01,202
You murdered people, Tate.

695
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,338
Kids. Like us.

696
00:38:03,405 --> 00:38:06,475
The kids that came to us on Halloween.

697
00:38:07,677 --> 00:38:10,145
Why would I do that?

698
00:38:11,615 --> 00:38:13,316
Why would I do that?

699
00:38:13,383 --> 00:38:16,452
Why would I do that?

700
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,588
No...
Why would I do that?

701
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:20,923
I don't know.

702
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:24,759
Why'd you kill those guys
who lived here before us?

703
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:27,395
Why would you rape my mother?

704
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:33,333
I'm sorry.

705
00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:35,266
I'm sorry.

706
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:36,970
I was different then.

707
00:38:37,037 --> 00:38:39,724
I used to think you were like me.

708
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:42,701
You were attracted to the darkness,

709
00:38:43,497 --> 00:38:45,947
but, Tate, you are the darkness.

710
00:38:46,752 --> 00:38:49,412
No. Before you,

711
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:50,994
that's all there was.

712
00:38:53,655 --> 00:38:56,290
You're the only light I've ever known.

713
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,539
You've changed me, Violet.

714
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:06,167
I believe that.

715
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,041
I love you, Tate.

716
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,676
But I can't forgive you.

717
00:39:17,043 --> 00:39:19,882
You have to pay for what you did.

718
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,518
All the pain you caused.

719
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:22,886
All the sorrow.

720
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:23,891
You murdered my mother.

721
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:25,588
No!
You did!

722
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:29,927
That baby-- whatever it was--
it killed her.

723
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:35,400
I can't be with you.

724
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,819
I won't be with you.

725
00:39:39,272 --> 00:39:42,040
What are you saying?

726
00:39:42,108 --> 00:39:43,346
I'm saying go away.

727
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,506
What?

728
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:46,932
No, no, don't do this.

729
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:48,134
Go away, Tate.

730
00:39:48,254 --> 00:39:51,116
You're all I want!
You're all I have!

731
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:52,550
Go away!

732
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,964
Go away!

733
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:36,062
That was very brave.

734
00:40:36,129 --> 00:40:37,570
I'm proud of you.

735
00:40:37,827 --> 00:40:39,351
Mom...

736
00:40:39,749 --> 00:40:41,472
I'm sorry, Mom.

737
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,638
I'm sorry you had to die.

738
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:45,524
Shh.

739
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:48,501
I'm sorry you lost your baby.

740
00:40:56,214 --> 00:40:59,522
But I didn't lose my baby.

741
