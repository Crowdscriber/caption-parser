1
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,756
Under blue moon,
I saw you

2
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,426
So soon
you'll take me

3
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:01,014
Up in your arms,
too late to beg you

4
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:04,810
Or cancel it
though I know it must be

5
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,313
The killing time

6
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,233
Unwillingly mine

7
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,778
Fate

8
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,990
Up against your will

9
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:23,036
Through the thick
and thin

10
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,915
He will wait until

11
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:30,627
You give yourself
to him

12
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,806
In starlit nights
I saw you

13
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,853
So cruelly
you kissed me

14
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:51,648
Your lips
a magic world

15
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,194
Your sky all hung
with jewels

16
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,822
The killing moon

17
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:02,201
Will come too soon

18
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,412
Fate

19
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:09,666
Up against your will

20
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,085
Through the thick
and thin...

21
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:23,472
I'm voting
for Dukakis.

22
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,811
Well...

23
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,565
Maybe when you have children
of your own

24
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,527
who need braces
and you can't afford them

25
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,946
because half
of your husband's paycheck

26
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,990
goes to the Federal Government,
you'll regret that.

27
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,700
My husband's
paycheck?

28
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:49,748
Anyway, I'm not going to squeeze
one out till I'm, like, 30.

29
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,959
Will you still be working
at the Yarn Barn?

30
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:54,461
Because I hear that's a great place
to raise children.

31
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,255
That's really funny.

32
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,007
No, I think a year
of partying is enough.

33
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:00,634
She'll be going
to Harvard next fall.

34
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,386
Mom, I haven't even
gotten in yet.

35
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,847
Do you honestly think
Michael Dukakis will provide

36
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,015
for this country till
you're ready to squeeze one out?

37
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,684
Yeah, I do.

38
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,854
- When can I squeeze one out?
- Not until 8th grade.

39
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,274
Excuse me?

40
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,776
Donnie, you're such
a dick.

41
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,862
Whoa, Elizabeth!

42
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,364
A little hostile there.

43
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,491
Maybe you should be
the one in therapy.

44
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,660
Then Mom and Dad
can pay someone $200 an hour

45
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,496
to listen to your thoughts
so we don't have to.

46
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,791
Okay.
You want to tell Mom and Dad

47
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,459
why you stopped taking
your medication?

48
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,212
- You're such a fuck-ass!
- What?!

49
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:39,089
Please.

50
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,383
Did you just call me
a "fuck-ass"?

51
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,386
- Elizabeth, that's enough.
- You can go suck a fuck.

52
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,930
Tell me, Elizabeth,
how does one suck a fuck?

53
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,765
- You want me to tell you?
- Tell me.

54
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,476
We will not have this
at the dinner table.

55
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,478
- Stop.
- Fuck.

56
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:06,241
What's a fuck-ass?

57
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:17,503
I'm reading.
Get out of my room.

58
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,091
Where do you go at night?

59
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,845
Would you just get out
of my room?

60
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,764
Did you toilet paper
the Johnsons' house?

61
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,349
Is that what
you came in here to ask me?

62
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:31,642
No.

63
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,395
I stopped rolling houses
in the sixth grade, Mom.

64
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,564
What happened to my son?

65
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,483
I don't recognize
this person today.

66
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,194
Then why don't you start
taking the goddamn pills?

67
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,539
Bitch.

68
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,175
Our son just
called me a bitch.

69
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,180
You're not
a bitch.

70
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:15,102
You're bitchen,
but you're not a bitch.

71
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,601
I want to be a President
of the United States

72
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,270
who makes sure that
we never again do business

73
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,647
with a drug-running
Panamanian dictator.

74
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,316
- That we never again...
- Dukakis!

75
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,151
funnel aid to the Contras
through convicted drug dealers.

76
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,028
Son of a bitch.

77
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,571
Panama is a friendly country.

78
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,115
I went down and talked
to the President of Panama...

79
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,159
- Tell him, George!
- about cleaning up

80
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:15,370
their money laundering.
And Mr. Noriega was there,

81
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:17,414
but there was no evidence
at that time.

82
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:20,292
When the evidence was there,
we indicted him.

83
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:25,380
Wake up.

84
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:50,697
I've been watching you.

85
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,476
Come closer.

86
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,904
Closer.

87
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,513
28 days...

88
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:00,309
six hours...

89
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,395
42 minutes...

90
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,148
12 seconds.

91
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,906
That is
when the world

92
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:16,074
will end.

93
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:18,368
Why?

94
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,808
Son?

95
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,102
Son.
Donnie Darko?

96
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,563
Donnie Darko.

97
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,106
What the heck's
going on here?

98
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,400
- Who is it?
- It's Eddie Darko's kid.

99
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,819
I'm sorry about this, Jim.
He's a neighborhood kid.

100
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,155
Guess he was
sleep-golfing?

101
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,534
Watch out
for that drool spot.

102
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,873
Are you all right, son?

103
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:55,632
So, let's stay off
the links at night, okay?

104
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,178
I'm sorry, Dr. Fisher.

105
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,221
It won't happen again.

106
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:03,223
Dr.I hate kids.

107
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,808
Let's golf.

108
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,021
Let's go, fire it up!

109
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,026
Donnie, Donnie, Donnie!

110
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,070
What happened
to your house?

111
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,491
- No one's allowed.
- This is my house.

112
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,368
- I said-
- This is my house!

113
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,747
He's okay.

114
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,213
...Channel 6 News.

115
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,882
We have just arrived
on the scene...

116
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,606
Wait a minute.

117
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,025
Here's your brother.

118
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,194
It fell in your room.

119
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,780
Watch yourself
down there!

120
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,092
Ms. Darko,
I'm Bob Garland.

121
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,927
I'm with
the F.A.A.

122
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,097
- The what?!
- I'm with the F.A.A.

123
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,933
We'd like to speak to you
and your husband privately.

124
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,018
- In private?
- Please.

125
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,813
All right.

126
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,081
And... here.

127
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,375
- You got it.
- All right.

128
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,253
We have arranged for you
to stay at a hotel.

129
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,131
Get some sleep and we will
take care of things here.

130
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:01,175
- Great.
- Thank you.

131
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,635
Kids, come on,
we're going to a hotel.

132
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,013
They don't know
where it came from.

133
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,598
That's good! Right there.

134
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:09,558
Just leave it.

135
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,476
Firefighter #2: Yeah,
just tying it off right now.

136
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,988
Local and national
transportation authorities

137
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,615
have begun
a nationwide search...

138
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,366
Frankie Feedler.

139
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,952
...despite the fact
that no airline will claim...

140
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,246
You remember him?

141
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,832
From high school.

142
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,877
The F.A.A. remained
tight-lipped on the details

143
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,754
of the current situation.

144
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,215
He died.

145
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,467
The engine,
which appears to have detached...

146
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,513
On his way to the prom.
Remember?

147
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:53,227
They said
he was doomed.

148
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,067
Jesus.

149
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:04,404
They could have said
the same thing about Donnie.

150
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,620
If it fell
from a plane,

151
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,706
then what happened
to the plane?

152
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,292
They don't know,
Samantha.

153
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:29,972
Mrs. Farmer will
bring you home after practice.

154
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:31,932
- Bye, Mommy!
- Bye, honey.

155
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:34,685
Donnie, good luck.

156
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,437
Oh, my God!
Okay, tell me everything.

157
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,440
- I'm not allowed to talk about it.
- Oh, my God.

158
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:43,068
- Hi, Cherita.
- Shut up!

159
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,070
Darko cheats death!

160
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,323
You're like
a celebrity.

161
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,284
I've been calling you
a jillion times.

162
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,286
- Where you been?
- We stayed at a hotel.

163
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,454
My dad said he saw you
at the golf course.

164
00:15:54,538 --> 00:15:56,456
You sleepwalking
again, buddy?

165
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,041
I don't want
to talk about it.

166
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,085
Boy #2:
And now that you're famous,

167
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,129
you gotta have
a smoke.

168
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,427
What happens if you tell
Mom and Dad about this, Sam?

169
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,221
You'll put Ariel
in the garbage disposal.

170
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,765
Goddamn right,
I will.

171
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,350
So grotty.

172
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:17,644
Hey, Cherita,
you want a cigarette?

173
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,480
- Chut up!
- Chut up!

174
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:23,150
Go back to China,
bitch!

175
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:27,821
Just leave her
alone.

176
00:16:27,863 --> 00:16:29,364
That's some good shit, huh?

177
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:31,783
It's a fucking cigarette.

178
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:11,031
I wanted to be
with you alone

179
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:16,411
And talk
about the weather

180
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,705
But traditions
I can trace

181
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,208
Against the child
in your face

182
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:24,920
Won't escape
my attention

183
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,885
You keep your distance
via the system of touch

184
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:35,347
And gentle persuasion

185
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:38,976
With one foot
in the past

186
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,395
Now just how long
will it last?

187
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,397
No, no, no

188
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,899
Have you no ambition?

189
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:51,780
You keep your distance
via the system of touch

190
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,868
And gentle persuasion

191
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,288
I'm lost in admiration

192
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,415
Could I need you
this much?

193
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,459
Oh, you're wasting
my time

194
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,504
You're, just, just,
just wasting time

195
00:18:07,588 --> 00:18:11,091
Something happens
and I'm head over heels

196
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,760
I never find out

197
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,681
Till I'm head over heels

198
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:21,852
Something happens,
and I'm head over heels

199
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,771
Ah, don't take my heart,
don't break my heart

200
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:28,567
Don't- don't-
don't throw it away

201
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:52,758
In my mind's eye

202
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:57,638
One little boy...
one little man

203
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,474
Funny how...

204
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:03,310
Time...

205
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,063
Flies.

206
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,106
"There would be headlines
in the papers.

207
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,734
Even the grown-up gangs
who ran the betting

208
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,069
at the all-in wrestling

209
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,779
and the barrow-boys
would hear with respect

210
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,573
of how Old Misery's house
had been destroyed.

211
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,160
It was as though
this plan had been

212
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,704
with him all his life,
pondered through the seasons,

213
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:26,500
now in his 15th year
crystallized

214
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,502
with the pain of puberty."

215
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,966
What is Graham Greene
trying to communicate

216
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,009
with this passage?

217
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:38,345
Why did the children
break into Old Misery's house?

218
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,933
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

219
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,978
Joanie, if you had actually
read the short story,

220
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:49,064
which, at a whopping 13 pages
would have kept you up all night,

221
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,817
- you would know that the children...
- You suck.

222
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,652
...find a great deal
of money in the mattress,

223
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,987
but they burn it.

224
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:00,784
Donnie Darko,

225
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,537
perhaps with your recent brush
with mass destruction,

226
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,164
you can give us
your opinion.

227
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:09,376
They say it right
when they flood the house

228
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,086
and they tear it
to shreds,

229
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:13,505
that destruction
is a form of creation.

230
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,009
So the fact that they
burn the money is ironic.

231
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,887
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

232
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,973
They want to change things.

233
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,398
May we help you?

234
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,442
Yeah, I just registered

235
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:35,444
and they put me
in the wrong English class.

236
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:37,905
You look like
you belong here.

237
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,492
Where do I sit?

238
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,706
Sit next to the boy
you think is the cutest.

239
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,833
- Quiet!

240
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,668
Let her choose.

241
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:14,483
Joanie, get up.

242
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,800
The construction guys
say it will take

243
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:41,718
about a week
to fix the roof.

244
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,471
That damned airline better not
fuck us on the shingle match.

245
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,224
They still don't know?

246
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:51,019
- Know what?
- Where it came from.

247
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:54,231
No. Apparently they can't
tell us what happened yet.

248
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:56,191
Something about...

249
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:59,278
a matching serial number
that got burned.

250
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,780
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.

251
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,493
So, we're not supposed
to tell anyone

252
00:22:06,577 --> 00:22:09,705
- what nobody knows?
- Yeah.

253
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,665
But, you tell-

254
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:14,501
What's your doctor's name?

255
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:16,336
- Dr. Thurman, Dad.
- Yes.

256
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,881
You tell Dr. Thurman
whatever you want.

257
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:22,009
- Dad?
- What?

258
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:23,719
Dad!

259
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,994
No mail today.
Maybe tomorrow.

260
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:08,430
Well?
What did she say to you?

261
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,730
I made a new friend.

262
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,690
Real or imaginary?

263
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,567
Imaginary.

264
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,528
Would you like to talk
about this friend?

265
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,822
- Frank.
- Frank.

266
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,784
- What did Frank say?
- He said to follow him.

267
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:31,411
- Follow him? Where?
- Into the future.

268
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:34,081
And then what happens?

269
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,418
And then he said...

270
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:43,173
Then he said that the world
was coming to an end.

271
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:45,509
Do you think the world
is coming to an end?

272
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,807
No.

273
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,311
That's stupid.

274
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:02,067
For my entire life,
I was a victim of my own fear.

275
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,070
Love.

276
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:09,324
I was feeding
fear through food.

277
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,496
Fear.

278
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:24,339
And finally, I looked
in the mirror.

279
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:27,050
Not just in the mirror...

280
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:29,469
I looked through
the mirror.

281
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,513
In that image,

282
00:24:31,597 --> 00:24:33,515
I saw my ego reflection.

283
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,770
For two years,
I thought it was normal

284
00:24:38,854 --> 00:24:41,315
for a 10-year-old
to wet the bed.

285
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,317
- We tried everything.
- Shh!

286
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,943
Quiet!

287
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,990
But the solution
was there all the time.

288
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,035
I'm not afraid anymore!

289
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,705
All over America,

290
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,291
people have come together
to join hands.

291
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,543
People who believe

292
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:03,837
that human life

293
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:06,673
is absolutely too important,

294
00:25:06,757 --> 00:25:08,634
too valuable,

295
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:12,054
and too precious
to be controlled by fear.

296
00:25:15,766 --> 00:25:18,852
Hello, my name
is Jim Cunningham.

297
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:20,896
And welcome
to "Controlling Fear."

298
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:35,077
Wake up, Donnie.

299
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:14,992
"And the prince was led
into a world

300
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,578
of strange
and beautiful magic."

301
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,621
Hey, you guys,
guess what?!

302
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:21,415
I can't
believe this!

303
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,459
My mom said the school
is closed today

304
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,712
- because it's flooded.
- No way.

305
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,839
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!

306
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:30,799
That's the best news
I've ever heard!

307
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:40,100
My God, is this
ever going to stop?

308
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:42,144
Eventually,
yes it will.

309
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:45,397
But right now I got
12 classrooms full of water,

310
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,816
all coming from
a busted water main.

311
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,777
- What else?
- What else?!

312
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:54,156
Principal Cole,
I'll show you what else.

313
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,328
That's unbelievable.

314
00:26:59,411 --> 00:27:01,038
That's solid bronze,
isn't it?

315
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,123
- Yep.
- How did this happen?

316
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:05,042
Beth's mom said
the boys' locker room

317
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,586
was flooded and they found
feces everywhere.

318
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,838
- What are feces?
- Baby mice.

319
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:10,797
Aw-ww...

320
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,693
Hey...

321
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:35,155
Has anyone ever told you
that you're sexy?

322
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:38,033
I like
your boobs.

323
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:39,660
Hey.

324
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,662
Hey.

325
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:44,832
School was cancelled.

326
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,293
Do you want
to walk me home?

327
00:27:48,377 --> 00:27:50,629
Sure.

328
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:02,641
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.

329
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,185
You should check
your backpack,

330
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,354
those guys love
to steal shit.

331
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,317
So, why did you
move here?

332
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:14,319
My parents
got a divorce.

333
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:16,947
My mom had to get a restraining
order against my stepdad.

334
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,492
- He has emotional problems.
- I have those, too.

335
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:23,328
What kind of emotional problems
does your dad have?

336
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:26,123
He stabbed my mom
four times in the chest.

337
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,959
Oh.

338
00:28:29,042 --> 00:28:30,961
Did he go
to jail?

339
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:34,506
No, he fled.
They still can't find him.

340
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:36,717
But my mom and I
had to change our names.

341
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,219
And I thought "Gretchen Ross"
was really cool.

342
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:43,140
I was in jail once.
I mean...

343
00:28:43,182 --> 00:28:45,142
I accidentally
burned down this house.

344
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,186
It was abandoned,
but still,

345
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:50,731
I got held back in school
and I can't drive until I'm 21.

346
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,983
But I'm over
all of that.

347
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,904
I'm painting
and stuff.

348
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,323
Writing.
I want to be a writer

349
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,200
or maybe a painter,
or maybe both.

350
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:04,495
I'll write a book
and draw the pictures.

351
00:29:04,578 --> 00:29:06,872
Then maybe people
will understand me.

352
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,957
I don't know,
change things.

353
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:12,127
"Donnie Darko"? What the hell
kind of name is that?

354
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:14,505
It's like some sort
of superhero or something.

355
00:29:15,881 --> 00:29:17,966
What makes you think I'm not?

356
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:24,306
I should go.

357
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,392
For physics, Monnitoff is having
me write this essay...

358
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:29,978
"Greatest invention
ever to benefit mankind."

359
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,025
It's Monnitoff.
But that's easy.

360
00:29:35,108 --> 00:29:36,902
Antiseptics.

361
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,238
The whole
sanitation thing.

362
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,240
Joseph Lister, 1895.

363
00:29:41,323 --> 00:29:43,700
Before antiseptics,
there was no sanitation,

364
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:45,619
especially
in medicine.

365
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,287
You mean, soap?

366
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,672
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.

367
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,715
Why is that?

368
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,594
Because you and I would have
never had this conversation.

369
00:30:04,221 --> 00:30:06,932
You're weird.

370
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:08,642
Sorry.

371
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:10,727
No, that was
a compliment.

372
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:16,483
Well, look...

373
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:21,321
you want to go
with me?

374
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,159
Where do you want
to go?

375
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,911
No, I mean, like,
"go" with me.

376
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,706
It's what
we call it here.

377
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,332
- "Going together."
- Sure.

378
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:37,963
Okay.
Where are you going?

379
00:30:40,883 --> 00:30:42,509
I'm going home.

380
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,975
So stupid!

381
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,935
"Where are you going?"

382
00:30:59,776 --> 00:31:02,488
I'd like to try
something new this time.

383
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:07,117
Have you ever been
hypnotized?

384
00:31:08,202 --> 00:31:09,828
No.

385
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:21,089
And when I clap
my hands twice,

386
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:23,509
you will wake up.
Do you understand?

387
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:26,094
Yes.

388
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,306
So... tell me
about your week.

389
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,475
I met a girl.

390
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,021
What is her name?

391
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:38,607
Gretchen.

392
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,985
We're going together now.

393
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:46,990
Do you still think
about girls a lot?

394
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,368
Yeah.

395
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,998
How are things
going at school?

396
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:57,751
I think about
girls a lot.

397
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:00,170
I asked you about school,
Donnie.

398
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:01,880
I think about...

399
00:32:01,964 --> 00:32:04,883
fucking a lot
during school.

400
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:08,637
What else do you think
about during school?

401
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,848
"Married With Children."

402
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,141
Do you think
about your family?

403
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:15,644
I just turn down the volume

404
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:18,355
and think about fucking
Christina Applegate.

405
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:21,108
I asked you about
your family, Donnie.

406
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,151
No.

407
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:26,029
I don't think about
fucking my family.

408
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:28,073
That's gross.

409
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:31,034
I'd like to hear
about your friend, Frank.

410
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:50,137
Sam Bylen?

411
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,223
Ahem.

412
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:09,823
Donald Darko.

413
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:34,932
Daye Dennis.

414
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,981
Hey, you fuck!

415
00:33:43,065 --> 00:33:45,609
Did you tell them that
I flooded the school?

416
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:49,530
I didn't say shit.

417
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,824
That's not what I heard.
They think I did it.

418
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:53,450
Yeah, well,
if you're innocent,

419
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:55,661
then you have nothing
to worry about, right?

420
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:58,622
Fuck you!
You know what I think?

421
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:02,209
I think you did it.

422
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:21,019
Beer and pussy,
that's all I need.

423
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,355
We gotta
find ourselves a Smurfette.

424
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:24,857
Smurfette?

425
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:26,358
Mm-hmm.

426
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,111
Not some, like, tight-ass,
Middlesex chick, you know?

427
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,487
Like this cute little blonde,

428
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,739
that will get down
and dirty with the guys.

429
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:35,868
- Like Smurfette does.
- Smurfette doesn't fuck.

430
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,705
That's bullshit.

431
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:41,498
Smurfette fucks
all the other Smurfs.

432
00:34:41,582 --> 00:34:43,167
Why do you think
Papa Smurf made her?

433
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,586
Because all the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

434
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:47,045
No, no, no,
not "Vanity."

435
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:48,547
I heard he was
a homosexual.

436
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,048
Okay, well,
you know what?

437
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:52,634
Then, she fucks them
while Vanity watches. Okay?

438
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:54,469
What about
Papa Smurf?

439
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,889
He must get in
on the action.

440
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,600
Yeah, what he does,
he films the gang-bang.

441
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,477
Later on, he beats off
to the tape.

442
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:05,063
First of all,

443
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,399
Papa Smurf didn't
create Smurfette.

444
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:10,027
Gargamel did. She was sent
in as Gargamel's evil spy

445
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,696
with the intention
of destroying the Smurf village.

446
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,573
But the overwhelming
goodness

447
00:35:14,615 --> 00:35:17,367
of the Smurf way of life
transformed her.

448
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:19,912
And as for the whole
gang-bang scenario,

449
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,498
it just couldn't happen.

450
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:26,001
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have...

451
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:29,338
reproductive organs under
those little white pants.

452
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:33,217
That's what's
so illogical, you know,

453
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,302
about being a Smurf.

454
00:35:35,344 --> 00:35:37,262
What's the point
of living...

455
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,765
if you don't
have a dick?

456
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:44,353
Damn it, Donnie.

457
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:46,355
Why do you gotta
get so smart on us?

458
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:49,816
- Grandma Death.

459
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,361
Excuse me! Excuse me!

460
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:55,781
Please stay off the road,
Miss Sparrow.

461
00:35:55,823 --> 00:35:57,282
If this happens again,

462
00:35:57,366 --> 00:35:59,034
I am going to call
Social Services.

463
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,661
I hate that
Mrs. Farmer.

464
00:36:00,661 --> 00:36:03,121
- Watch your step. That's it.
- She's such a fucking bitch.

465
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,833
- There you are, that's a girl.
- Yeah.

466
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:08,919
- How old is Grandma Death?
- 101.

467
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,965
She does the same thing
every day.

468
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,967
Just walks
back and forth

469
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,012
and back and forth
to the mailbox.

470
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:21,598
Nothing
ever in there.

471
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:25,853
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

472
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:31,316
She goes-
she's going back to the box.

473
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,193
We may
still have mail.

474
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:35,070
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

475
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:36,864
- And...?
- This could be it.

476
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:39,241
Oh-hhh!

477
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,910
No dice, Grandma.
No, sorry. Sorry.

478
00:36:41,994 --> 00:36:43,912
Someone ought
to write that bitch.

479
00:36:45,414 --> 00:36:47,249
Authorities
continued their search today

480
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:50,002
for a suspect in the Middlesex
Ridge School vandalism.

481
00:36:50,043 --> 00:36:52,588
The private school has
asked for public donations

482
00:36:52,671 --> 00:36:54,381
to help restore
its beloved mascot,

483
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,967
known only as "The Mongrel."
In other news-

484
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:04,975
In cooperation
with the county police,

485
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,394
we have begun
an active investigation

486
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:09,730
into the cause
of the flooding.

487
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:13,483
And our suspects include
several of our own students-

488
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:15,652
Mrs. I want
to know why this filth

489
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,529
is being taught
to our children.

490
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:19,364
That's what I want to know.

491
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,374
Kitty,
I would appreciate-

492
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:30,959
Let her speak,
for God's sake!

493
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:33,128
- If you would wait-
- Dr. Cole,

494
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:35,047
not only am I a teacher,

495
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,759
but I am also a parent
of a Middlesex child.

496
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:41,386
Therefore I am
the only person here

497
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:44,473
who transcends
the parent-teacher bridge.

498
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:50,229
Don't worry.

499
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,856
You got away with it.

500
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,399
I have in my hand

501
00:37:54,483 --> 00:37:56,443
Graham Greene's
"The Destructors."

502
00:37:56,527 --> 00:37:58,111
This short story

503
00:37:58,195 --> 00:38:00,906
is part of my daughter's
English assignment.

504
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:02,658
We're with you, Kitty!

505
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,868
In this story,
several children

506
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:07,955
destroy an elderly man's
house from inside out.

507
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:23,053
How can you do that?

508
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:32,354
And how do they do this?

509
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:34,064
They flood the house

510
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,109
by breaking through
a water main.

511
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:41,280
I can do anything I want.

512
00:38:42,531 --> 00:38:44,241
And so can you.

513
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:46,535
We pay good money
for this school.

514
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,620
- It's our children!

515
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:51,832
And I think that this garbage
should be removed.

516
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,792
Excuse me.

517
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:56,712
What is the real issue here?
The P.T.A. doesn't ban books.

518
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,548
The P.T.A. is here
to acknowledge

519
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:02,968
that pornography is being
taught in our curriculum!

520
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,845
It's meant
to be ironic.

521
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:07,723
Excuse me. You need
to go back to grad school.

522
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:10,934
Why did you make me
flood the school?

523
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,609
They are in great danger.

524
00:39:18,692 --> 00:39:20,152
- We have rights here!
- Kitty...

525
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,987
do you even know
who Graham Greene is?

526
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,574
I think we have
all seen "Bonanza."

527
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:30,120
Well...

528
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:32,664
- Good work, Kitty.
- while we are on other topics...

529
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:34,583
Where did you come from?

530
00:39:36,418 --> 00:39:39,046
Do you believe
in time travel?

531
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:43,342
Who are you talking to?

532
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,349
I was just taking
my pills, Sam.

533
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:01,902
It is time
to breathe.

534
00:40:03,153 --> 00:40:05,197
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

535
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,407
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.

536
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:12,621
So now let us begin Life Line
Exercise Number One.

537
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:15,290
Please press "Stop" now.

538
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:23,799
Mrs.As you can see,

539
00:40:23,882 --> 00:40:25,759
the Life Line is divided

540
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,803
into two polar extremes.

541
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:30,430
Fear and love.

542
00:40:30,514 --> 00:40:34,309
Fear is in the negative
energy spectrum.

543
00:40:34,393 --> 00:40:37,437
And love is in the positive
energy spectrum.

544
00:40:37,521 --> 00:40:39,565
No duh.

545
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,276
Excuse me?
"No duh..."

546
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:44,403
is a product of fear.

547
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:48,407
Now, on each card

548
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:50,868
is a character dilemma

549
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,620
which applies
to the Life Line.

550
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,583
Please- take this!

551
00:40:57,624 --> 00:40:59,459
Thank you.

552
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:02,296
Please read each
character dilemma aloud,

553
00:41:02,379 --> 00:41:04,423
and place an "X"

554
00:41:04,506 --> 00:41:07,259
on the Life Line
in the appropriate place.

555
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:09,261
Cherita?

556
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,272
"Juanita has an important
math test today.

557
00:41:20,355 --> 00:41:22,858
She has known about the test
for several weeks,

558
00:41:22,941 --> 00:41:25,194
but has not studied.

559
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:28,655
In order to keep
from failing her class

560
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,657
Juanita decides
that she will

561
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,743
cheat on the math test."

562
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:38,332
Good, good.
Very good.

563
00:41:38,415 --> 00:41:39,917
Mr. Darko.

564
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,594
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
on the ground filled with money.

565
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:53,138
She takes the wallet to the address
on the driver's license

566
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:56,016
but keeps the money inside
the wallet."

567
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:00,020
I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Farmer.
I don't get this.

568
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:01,772
Just place an "X"
on the Life Line

569
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,148
in the appropriate place.

570
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:06,652
No. I know what to do.
I just- I don't get this.

571
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,570
You can't lump things
into two categories.

572
00:42:08,654 --> 00:42:10,155
Things aren't that simple.

573
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:12,407
The Life Line is
divided that way.

574
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,868
Life isn't that simple.

575
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:17,371
I mean, who cares
if Ling Ling

576
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,706
returns the wallet
and keeps the money?

577
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,917
It has nothing to do
with either fear or love.

578
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,670
Fear and love are the deepest
of human emotions.

579
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:27,297
Okay. But you're
not listening to me.

580
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:30,551
There are other things that
need to be taken into account.

581
00:42:30,592 --> 00:42:32,845
Like the whole spectrum
of human emotion.

582
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:36,014
You can't just lump everything
into these two categories

583
00:42:36,098 --> 00:42:37,933
and then just deny
everything else.

584
00:42:38,016 --> 00:42:40,060
If you don't complete
the assignment,

585
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,271
you'll get a zero
for the day.

586
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:49,069
Donald...

587
00:42:49,111 --> 00:42:51,196
let me preface this
by saying

588
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,740
that your Iowa Test
scores are...

589
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:56,243
intimidating.

590
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,330
So...

591
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,416
let's go over
this again.

592
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,836
What exactly did you say
to Mrs. Farmer?

593
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,923
Mrs.I'll tell you what he said.

594
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,800
He asked me
to forcibly insert

595
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:14,178
the Life Line exercise card
into my anus!

596
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:23,187
These are modern times.

597
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,230
My political attitudes
are forthright.

598
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:27,691
And if there's
a Vice-Presidential candidate

599
00:43:27,774 --> 00:43:30,569
worthy of my vote,
it has to be Dan Quayle.

600
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:33,155
Mrs. Nobody cares
about responsibility,

601
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:35,115
morality, family values.

602
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,950
Mm-hmm.

603
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,663
Kitty...

604
00:43:41,747 --> 00:43:43,499
Excuse us, please.

605
00:43:47,711 --> 00:43:50,547
They've suspended him
from afterschool activities

606
00:43:50,631 --> 00:43:52,591
for the next six months.

607
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:57,137
Ever since
this jet engine fiasco,

608
00:43:57,221 --> 00:43:59,640
I honestly don't know
what's gotten into him-

609
00:43:59,681 --> 00:44:01,558
Rose, I'll tell you this
because our daughters

610
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,852
have been on the dance team
together for two years,

611
00:44:03,936 --> 00:44:05,771
and I respect you
as a woman.

612
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:08,440
But after witnessing your son's
behavior this afternoon,

613
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,567
I have significant
doubts about your-

614
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,906
Our paths through life
must be righteous.

615
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:18,742
I urge you to go home
and look in the mirror,

616
00:44:18,826 --> 00:44:22,746
and pray that your son doesn't
succumb to the path of fear.

617
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:30,671
Wait. Do you remember

618
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:33,048
that weird gym teacher,
Mrs. Farmer?

619
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:37,135
Yeah. Okay, well,
my brother

620
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:39,596
told her to shove
a book up her ass today.

621
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,016
And then my parents just
bought him all this new shit.

622
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:47,813
Yeah, I know. I wish a jet engine
would fall in my room.

623
00:44:51,024 --> 00:44:53,360
I can show you the way.

624
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:08,792
- Dr. Monnitoff?
- Donnie.

625
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:11,712
I know this is gonna sound
kind of weird,

626
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:14,840
but... do you know
anything about...

627
00:45:14,882 --> 00:45:16,758
time travel?

628
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:24,600
Dr. Ah, a wormhole with
an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

629
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:26,435
which is...

630
00:45:26,518 --> 00:45:28,520
theoretically,
a wormhole in space

631
00:45:28,604 --> 00:45:30,439
controlled by man.

632
00:45:32,733 --> 00:45:34,985
So, according to Hawking,

633
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:38,280
a wormhole may be able
to provide a shortcut

634
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:41,575
for jumping between two distant
regions of space-time.

635
00:45:41,617 --> 00:45:45,162
In order to travel back in time,
you have to have a big spaceship

636
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:47,247
or something that can travel
faster than the speed of light?

637
00:45:47,331 --> 00:45:48,916
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find

638
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:49,458
one of these wormholes?

639
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,794
The basic principles
of time travel are there.

640
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:54,087
You've got your vessel
and your portal,

641
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,381
and your vessel could be
just about anything,

642
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:59,009
- most likely a spacecraft.
- Like a DeLorean?

643
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:00,761
Metal craft
of any kind.

644
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:02,763
You know, I love that movie,
the way they shot it.

645
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:04,264
It's so...

646
00:46:04,306 --> 00:46:06,099
like futuristic,
you know?

647
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:09,561
Listen...

648
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:11,897
Don't tell anybody
that I gave you this.

649
00:46:11,939 --> 00:46:14,525
The woman who wrote this
used to teach here.

650
00:46:14,608 --> 00:46:17,945
She was a nun many years
before that, but...

651
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:20,781
then overnight,
she just-

652
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:23,283
she became this
entirely different person.

653
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,577
She up and left the church,
she wrote this book.

654
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:29,498
She started
teaching science,

655
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,166
right here in Middlesex.

656
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,294
"The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

657
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:37,047
Roberta Sparrow?

658
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:39,216
That's right.

659
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:42,970
Come on.

660
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:45,055
Roberta Sparrow?

661
00:47:04,867 --> 00:47:06,952
Roberta Sparrow.

662
00:47:08,328 --> 00:47:10,622
"Grandma Death."

663
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:14,459
It's called "The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

664
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:18,088
What does philosophy
have to do with time travel?

665
00:47:18,172 --> 00:47:20,340
- Let me see.
- Guess who wrote it.

666
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:21,925
Who?

667
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:24,052
Roberta Sparrow?!

668
00:47:24,136 --> 00:47:26,263
Huh. She wrote a book.

669
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:29,224
"Grandma Death"
wrote a book.

670
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:31,351
That's a terrible
nickname.

671
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:34,438
We almost hit her
with the car the other day.

672
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:38,192
She lives up there
in that piece of crap house

673
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:40,235
and you know
she's loaded. She's-

674
00:47:40,277 --> 00:47:41,987
Yeah, you're right.

675
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,032
She used to be known
for her gem collection.

676
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:47,367
Kids...

677
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:49,786
used to go up there
all the time

678
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,830
and try to steal stuff
from her.

679
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:53,665
She became
a total recluse.

680
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:57,085
Huh- I didn't even know
she was alive

681
00:47:57,169 --> 00:47:59,796
till we damn near knocked
her down the other day.

682
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:04,635
She was just standing there

683
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,720
in the middle
of the road, frozen.

684
00:48:06,803 --> 00:48:08,680
So I got out of the car

685
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,600
and I walked over to her
to see if she was okay.

686
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,228
And she leaned over
and whispered in my ear.

687
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,979
What did she say?

688
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:18,148
I think Frank wants me
to go talk to her,

689
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,025
because the last time
I saw him,

690
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:22,236
he asked me if I knew
about time travel.

691
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:24,196
She wrote a book
about it,

692
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:25,906
so that can't be
a coincidence, right?

693
00:48:28,826 --> 00:48:31,328
Donnie, what did
Roberta Sparrow say to you?

694
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:36,166
She said that every living
creature on Earth dies alone.

695
00:48:40,754 --> 00:48:43,131
How did that
make you feel?

696
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:49,763
It reminded me
of my dog, Callie.

697
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,975
She died
when I was eight,

698
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:55,435
and she crawled
underneath...

699
00:48:55,477 --> 00:48:57,312
the porch.

700
00:49:00,232 --> 00:49:01,984
To die?

701
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:06,488
To be alone.

702
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:11,368
Do you feel
alone right now?

703
00:49:15,497 --> 00:49:17,332
I don't know.

704
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:22,504
I'd like to believe
I'm not, but I just-

705
00:49:24,256 --> 00:49:26,717
I've just never
seen any proof, so I-

706
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,178
I just don't
debate it anymore, you know?

707
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:31,054
It's like I could
spend my whole life

708
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:34,016
debating it over and over again,
weighing the pros and cons,

709
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,643
and in the end, I still wouldn't
have any proof. So I just-

710
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,604
I just don't debate it
any more.

711
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:41,148
It's absurd.

712
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:47,196
The search for God
is absurd?

713
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:51,909
It is if everyone
dies alone.

714
00:49:53,202 --> 00:49:54,786
Does that scare you?

715
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:00,542
I don't want
to be alone.

716
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:16,558
And so his tapes
have made me realize

717
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:18,977
that for the last
39 years,

718
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:21,730
I have been a prisoner
of my own fear.

719
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:23,816
Fear?

720
00:50:23,899 --> 00:50:27,027
Rose, you have got
to meet this Jim Cunningham.

721
00:50:28,612 --> 00:50:30,906
I can't believe
he's single.

722
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:33,951
And it has been
a disappointing night

723
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:36,036
indeed for these
Super Bowl champions.

724
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:37,996
Announcer #2:
You're right, Dan.

725
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,832
Coach Joe Gibbs
is on the sidelines,

726
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:42,376
water dripping off his glasses,
but he's gotta be thinking,

727
00:50:42,459 --> 00:50:45,087
"What happened?
What went wrong tonight?"

728
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,588
And here's the kick...

729
00:50:48,423 --> 00:50:50,759
And it's no good.

730
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:53,804
- Shit, we need a quarterback.
- And a miracle.

731
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:56,139
We need to go for a safety.

732
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,935
Mark Rypien
has some big shoes to fill,

733
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:01,311
that's for certain.

734
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,938
Announcer #2:
He sure does.

735
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,941
So what the future holds
for this Super Bowl M.V.P.

736
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:07,776
we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

737
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:14,032
- You guys want anything?
- No.

738
00:51:14,116 --> 00:51:16,493
Darrell Green again
with a display of amazing speed...

739
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:18,579
I'm gonna get a beer.

740
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,306
...deep into the end zone.

741
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,433
It's gonna be brought out
to the 20-yard line.

742
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:42,352
First down and 10.

743
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:45,439
Good evening,
ladies and ghouls.

744
00:51:45,522 --> 00:51:48,150
Join us at the Middlesex
Pavilion Mall

745
00:51:48,233 --> 00:51:51,778
for the Middlesex
Halloween Haunt...

746
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:19,324
And what if
you could go back in time

747
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,910
and take all those hours
of pain and darkness

748
00:53:21,952 --> 00:53:24,246
and replace them
with something better?

749
00:53:24,288 --> 00:53:26,206
Like images, or what?

750
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,751
Yeah, like a Hawaiian sunset
or the Grand Canyon.

751
00:53:29,793 --> 00:53:32,337
Things that remind you
of how beautiful the world-

752
00:53:32,421 --> 00:53:34,339
We've been going together
for like, two weeks.

753
00:53:35,966 --> 00:53:37,342
Yeah?

754
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,471
Well, I...

755
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:45,893
Do you want to kiss me?

756
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:56,028
- I- I'm sorry.
- Look, Donnie, wait.

757
00:53:56,111 --> 00:53:59,615
- I like you a lot.
- I just want it to be...

758
00:53:59,656 --> 00:54:02,493
at a time when it...

759
00:54:02,534 --> 00:54:04,453
When what?

760
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:06,788
When it
reminds me-just...

761
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:11,335
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?

762
00:54:12,503 --> 00:54:14,296
Yeah.

763
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:18,217
And right now there's some fat guy
over there staring at us.

764
00:54:24,765 --> 00:54:28,685
Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.

765
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:31,772
We both felt
that it was time

766
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,398
for us to come in
and discuss...

767
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:36,193
What I think is
going on with your son?

768
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:38,737
Yes.

769
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,990
Well, he's-

770
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:45,744
You know
about his past,

771
00:54:45,828 --> 00:54:47,371
and he was suspended
from school

772
00:54:47,454 --> 00:54:49,957
for insulting
his gym teacher.

773
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,959
I'm not really sure
that's a good example.

774
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,670
I think he had just cause
to insult her.

775
00:54:54,711 --> 00:54:57,464
Rose, let me
just lay out

776
00:54:57,548 --> 00:54:58,924
what I believe
is happening here.

777
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:04,471
Dr.Donnie's aggressive behavior...

778
00:55:06,056 --> 00:55:09,893
his increased detachment
from reality,

779
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:13,939
seem to stem
from his inability to cope

780
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:17,484
with the forces in the world
he perceives to be threatening.

781
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:25,742
Has he ever told you
about his friend Frank?

782
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:32,374
Frank?

783
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,751
Yes, the giant
bunny rabbit.

784
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,504
The what?

785
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:44,219
I don't recall...

786
00:55:44,261 --> 00:55:47,222
him ever having
mentioned a rabbit.

787
00:55:47,264 --> 00:55:50,017
Donnie is experiencing
what is commonly called

788
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,060
a daylight hallucination.

789
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:59,902
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

790
00:56:02,154 --> 00:56:03,989
What can we do?

791
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:06,200
I would like to...

792
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:07,993
do more hypnotherapy,

793
00:56:10,329 --> 00:56:12,706
and increase his medication.

794
00:56:18,962 --> 00:56:21,798
Whatever will help him, really,

795
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,302
because that's why
we're here.

796
00:56:25,344 --> 00:56:28,805
We just would like him
to experience some...

797
00:56:28,847 --> 00:56:30,849
relief.

798
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:34,645
So if you think that
more medication will do that,

799
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:40,067
then I think we should
give it a try.

800
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:54,373
Donnie Darko.

801
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:59,127
I know.

802
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:09,888
Good morning,
you mongrels!

803
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,265
Good morning.

804
00:57:11,348 --> 00:57:13,058
Is that all the gusto
you can muster?

805
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:14,434
I said, "Good morning!"

806
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:17,062
Good morning!

807
00:57:17,146 --> 00:57:18,981
Now that's a tiny,
tiny bit better.

808
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:21,608
But I can still sense
some students out there

809
00:57:21,692 --> 00:57:24,862
who are actually afraid
to say, "Good morning!"

810
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:28,198
- Good morning!
- Yeah, that's what I like to hear!

811
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:31,493
Because entirely too many
young men and women today

812
00:57:31,535 --> 00:57:34,872
are completely paralyzed
by their fears.

813
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:39,001
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation

814
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:43,046
and destruction of drugs,
alcohol, and premarital sex.

815
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:47,968
Now, I'm going to tell you
a little story today.

816
00:57:48,051 --> 00:57:50,304
It's a heartbreakingly
sad story

817
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,389
about a young man

818
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:54,725
whose life was
completely destroyed

819
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:56,977
by these instruments
of fear.

820
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,896
A young man,

821
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:02,232
searching for love
in all the wrong places.

822
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:06,028
His name was Frank.

823
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:11,992
Hi, my stepsister...

824
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:14,870
like, I sometimes worry
that she eats too much.

825
00:58:14,912 --> 00:58:17,372
- Shut up, Kim!
- Sweetheart, please.

826
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:19,458
How can I decide what I want
to be when I grow up?

827
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:20,834
That's a hard one.

828
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:24,129
What do I do
to learn how to fight?

829
00:58:24,213 --> 00:58:27,591
"What do I do
to learn how to fight?"

830
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:31,595
Son, violence is
a product of fear.

831
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:33,430
Learn to truly love
yourself.

832
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:35,807
- Okay.
- Okay, get yourself up here.

833
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,685
- Okay.
- All right.

834
00:58:41,939 --> 00:58:44,066
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

835
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:46,151
Um...

836
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:47,820
How much are they
paying you to be here?

837
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:50,781
Uh... excuse me?

838
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,660
What is your name, son?

839
00:58:54,743 --> 00:58:56,578
Gerald.

840
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,163
Well, Gerald,

841
00:58:58,247 --> 00:58:59,748
I think you're afraid.

842
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:01,583
Are you telling us this stuff
so we can buy your book?

843
00:59:01,625 --> 00:59:03,585
Because I got to tell you,
if you are,

844
00:59:03,627 --> 00:59:05,546
that was some of the worst
advice I ever heard.

845
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,214
Do you see
how sad this is?

846
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:08,757
Do you want your sister
to lose weight?

847
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:10,676
Tell her to get off the couch,
stop eating Twinkies,

848
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:13,804
and maybe go out for field hockey.
You know what?

849
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:16,390
No one ever knows what they
want to be when they grow up.

850
00:59:16,473 --> 00:59:19,184
It takes a little while
to find that out.

851
00:59:19,226 --> 00:59:21,145
Right, Jim?
And you...

852
00:59:21,186 --> 00:59:23,313
Yeah, you.

853
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:27,442
Sick of some jerk shoving
your head down the toilet?

854
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:29,653
Maybe you should
lift some weights

855
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:32,156
or take a karate lesson.
And the next time he tries to do it,

856
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:34,074
you kick him
in the balls.

857
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:38,412
Son. Do you see this?

858
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:40,706
- Right?
- This is an anger prisoner,

859
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,416
- Remove him.
- A textbook example.

860
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:44,001
Do you see
the fear, people?

861
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:46,920
This boy is scared to death
of the truth.

862
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:50,132
Son, it breaks my heart
to say this,

863
00:59:50,215 --> 00:59:54,761
but I believe you are a very
troubled and confused young man.

864
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:57,806
I believe you are searching for
the answers in all the wrong places.

865
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:59,516
You're right, actually.

866
00:59:59,558 --> 01:00:00,893
I am pretty-
I'm pretty troubled

867
01:00:00,934 --> 01:00:02,895
and I'm pretty confused,
but I-

868
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,898
and I'm afraid, really,
really afraid.

869
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:07,399
Really afraid.
But I-

870
01:00:07,441 --> 01:00:09,401
I think you're
the fucking Antichrist.

871
01:00:11,487 --> 01:00:14,364
Get him out of here!
Who do you think you are?

872
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:23,749
It's amazing.

873
01:00:23,832 --> 01:00:25,667
The man thinks
he's telling the truth,

874
01:00:25,751 --> 01:00:28,754
and everything he says
is just a fucking lie!

875
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:31,048
Everything he says!

876
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:34,551
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud.

877
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:36,929
- Everything he does-
- Are you okay?

878
01:00:40,766 --> 01:00:44,228
- Yeah.
- Sit down. Calm down.

879
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,318
You ever hear
of Grandma Death?

880
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:53,737
Who?

881
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:01,328
"The Philosophy
of Time Travel."

882
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,539
What is this?

883
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,082
She wrote it.

884
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:16,468
I'm-

885
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,303
I've been seeing stuff.

886
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:21,098
Like, a lot of really
messed up stuff.

887
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:23,976
And there are chapters
in that book

888
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:25,811
that describe the stuff
I've been seeing.

889
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:27,938
It can't just be
a coincidence.

890
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:33,318
Dr. Each vessel
travels along a vector...

891
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,280
through space-time,
along its center of gravity.

892
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,906
Like a spear.

893
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,576
I beg your pardon?

894
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:43,370
Like a spear
that comes out of your chest.

895
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:46,081
Umm... sure.

896
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:49,793
And in order for the vessel
to travel through time,

897
01:01:49,835 --> 01:01:52,838
it's got to find a portal,
or in this case a wormhole-

898
01:01:52,921 --> 01:01:54,923
Could these portals-

899
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:59,178
Could these portals
just appear anywhere, anytime?

900
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:01,305
I think that's
highly unlikely.

901
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:03,348
No, I think what you're
talking about is...

902
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:04,808
an act of God.

903
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,352
If God controls time,
then all time is pre-decided.

904
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:11,064
I'm not following you.

905
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:13,609
Every living thing
follows along a set path.

906
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:17,029
And if you could see
your path or channel,

907
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,281
then you could see
into the future, right?

908
01:02:19,364 --> 01:02:21,492
Like... that's
a form of time travel.

909
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:25,287
Well, you're
contradicting yourself.

910
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:27,080
If we were able to see

911
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:29,583
our destinies manifest
themselves visually,

912
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:31,710
then we would be
given a choice

913
01:02:31,793 --> 01:02:34,171
to betray
our chosen destinies.

914
01:02:34,213 --> 01:02:35,881
And the mere fact
that this choice exists,

915
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:40,344
would make all pre-formed
destiny come to an end.

916
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:42,179
Not if you travel
within God's channel.

917
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:46,725
Um...

918
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:50,979
I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

919
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:56,068
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

920
01:02:57,903 --> 01:02:59,488
Okay.

921
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,460
Now you know where he lives.

922
01:03:57,921 --> 01:04:00,382
Dr. And they grow
out of our chest...

923
01:04:00,465 --> 01:04:02,342
solar plexus?

924
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:04,469
Just like she
described in the book,

925
01:04:04,553 --> 01:04:06,930
the way they moved
and they smelled.

926
01:04:06,972 --> 01:04:08,682
It's like-
like they're workers.

927
01:04:10,434 --> 01:04:12,186
Assigned to each one of us.

928
01:04:12,269 --> 01:04:14,855
They just-
they're like liquid.

929
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:18,650
I followed it...

930
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:21,320
into my parents' bedroom.

931
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:22,988
What did you find?

932
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,953
Nothing.

933
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,835
So we call them IMGs.

934
01:04:36,877 --> 01:04:39,296
Infant Memory Generators.

935
01:04:39,338 --> 01:04:42,341
The idea is that you buy
these glasses for your infant,

936
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:44,343
and they wear them
at night when they sleep.

937
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:48,931
But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs.

938
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:52,518
And each photograph is of something
peaceful or beautiful...

939
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:55,145
whatever the parents
want to put inside.

940
01:04:55,229 --> 01:04:57,815
And what effect do you think
this would have on an infant?

941
01:04:57,856 --> 01:05:00,108
Well...

942
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:02,027
the thing is, nobody
remembers their infancy.

943
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:04,404
Anyone who says
they do is lying.

944
01:05:04,488 --> 01:05:06,907
So we think this will help develop
memory earlier in life.

945
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,408
Yeah.

946
01:05:08,492 --> 01:05:10,953
Did you stop and think that maybe
infants need darkness?

947
01:05:11,036 --> 01:05:13,997
That maybe darkness is part
of their natural development?

948
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:19,586
- No.
- Mm-mm.

949
01:05:22,506 --> 01:05:23,966
Yeah.

950
01:05:24,049 --> 01:05:26,635
What if the parents
put in pictures of Satan?

951
01:05:26,718 --> 01:05:28,637
Or, like, dead people?
Crap like that.

952
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,181
Is that what you'd
show your kids?

953
01:05:32,808 --> 01:05:34,852
Well, I mean...

954
01:05:34,935 --> 01:05:37,980
didn't your dad, like,
stab your mom?

955
01:05:47,364 --> 01:05:49,283
Get out.

956
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:53,453
Gretchen!
I'm sorry, Gretchen.

957
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:55,873
Gretchen,
I'm sorry about those guys.

958
01:05:55,956 --> 01:05:57,249
They're fucking-

959
01:06:24,151 --> 01:06:25,861
Two for "Evil Dead,"
please.

960
01:06:25,944 --> 01:06:28,322
That'll be $2.

961
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:18,747
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?

962
01:07:23,585 --> 01:07:26,839
Why are you wearing
that stupid man suit?

963
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,725
Take it off.

964
01:07:58,203 --> 01:08:00,289
What happened
to your eye?

965
01:08:06,753 --> 01:08:09,256
I'm so sorry.

966
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,515
Why do they
call you Frank?

967
01:08:18,599 --> 01:08:21,602
It is the name
of my father...

968
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:27,191
and his father
before me.

969
01:08:30,944 --> 01:08:32,738
Frank?

970
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:38,619
When's this going
to stop?

971
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,246
You should already
know that.

972
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:47,085
I want you
to watch the movie screen.

973
01:08:49,213 --> 01:08:51,882
There's something
I want to show you.

974
01:09:00,015 --> 01:09:02,518
Have you ever
seen a portal?

975
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:22,704
Burn it to the ground.

976
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:39,698
Okay, now girls...

977
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:41,074
I want you
to concentrate.

978
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:43,911
Failure is not
an option.

979
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:47,915
And Bethany, if you feel
the need to vomit up there...

980
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:51,168
-just swallow it.
- Okay, Mom.

981
01:10:51,251 --> 01:10:53,837
Hey, you guys,
good luck out there.

982
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:12,564
Get off the stage, Cherita!

983
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,195
You suck!

984
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:27,955
Hold on.

985
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:34,795
Now that was
really something.

986
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:37,297
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel."

987
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:41,176
And now the moment we've
all been waiting for is here.

988
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:43,136
It is my very distinct
pleasure

989
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:44,930
to introduce to you...

990
01:11:45,013 --> 01:11:46,807
Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey,

991
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:49,309
Samantha Darko,
Beth Farmer,

992
01:11:49,351 --> 01:11:52,396
and Joanie James.
They are... "Sparkle Motion."

993
01:11:54,189 --> 01:11:59,236
No- no- notorious...
Notorious

994
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:05,993
No- no-
notorious

995
01:12:15,377 --> 01:12:19,047
I can't read about it

996
01:12:19,131 --> 01:12:23,177
Burns the skin
from your eyes

997
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:28,265
I'll do fine
without it

998
01:12:29,391 --> 01:12:32,352
Here's one
you don't compromise

999
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:38,192
Lies come
hard in disguise

1000
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:42,779
They need to fight it out,
not wild about it

1001
01:12:42,863 --> 01:12:46,575
Lay your seedy judgments

1002
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:50,579
Who says they're
part of our lives?

1003
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:53,290
You own the money

1004
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:56,043
You control the witness

1005
01:12:56,084 --> 01:12:57,711
I'll leave you lonely

1006
01:12:57,794 --> 01:13:00,088
Don't monkey
with my business

1007
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,216
You pay the prophets

1008
01:13:02,299 --> 01:13:04,927
To justify your reasons

1009
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,263
I heard your promise,
but I don't believe it

1010
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:10,140
That's why
I've done it again...

1011
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:39,545
All right, Sparkle Motion!

1012
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:50,199
How long was I asleep for?

1013
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,701
Whole movie.

1014
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:04,129
Captain...

1015
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:05,964
looks like we've got
another room back here.

1016
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:09,009
The blaze was extinguished

1017
01:15:09,051 --> 01:15:11,637
sometime after 8:00 last night.

1018
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:14,473
Firefighters discovered
what has been referred to

1019
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:16,934
as a "kiddie porn dungeon."

1020
01:15:17,017 --> 01:15:19,520
Cunningham, who has become
a recent celebrity

1021
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:21,271
for his books
and motivational tapes,

1022
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:24,107
- was arrested early this morning...
- Oh, my God!

1023
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:26,819
...at Sarasota Heights Country Club.

1024
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:28,737
Arson has not
been ruled out

1025
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:30,572
as part of the cause
of the fire.

1026
01:15:30,614 --> 01:15:34,409
A group of Cunning Vision
employees...

1027
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:36,411
Oh, my God.
Dad played golf with that guy.

1028
01:15:36,453 --> 01:15:38,872
...vehemently denied
the alleged link

1029
01:15:38,914 --> 01:15:41,083
to a child pornography
publishing circuit.

1030
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:42,960
In a vicious statement,

1031
01:15:43,043 --> 01:15:45,879
Cunningham attacked the Middlesex
Fire Department officials,

1032
01:15:45,921 --> 01:15:48,173
claiming a vast conspiracy.

1033
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:51,301
I'm sorry, Karen,
but we don't think the methods

1034
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:53,887
you've undertaken here
are appropriate.

1035
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:56,723
With all due respect, sir,
what exactly about my methods

1036
01:15:56,765 --> 01:15:58,767
do you find
inappropriate?

1037
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:02,437
I don't have time to get
into a debate about this.

1038
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:05,607
I believe I've
made myself clear.

1039
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:08,402
You call this clarity?

1040
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:09,987
I don't think
that you have a clue

1041
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,364
what it's like to communicate
with these kids.

1042
01:16:12,447 --> 01:16:16,368
And we are losing them
to apathy...

1043
01:16:18,287 --> 01:16:21,623
to this prescribed nonsense.

1044
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:24,877
They are slipping away.

1045
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:27,796
I am sorry
that you have failed.

1046
01:16:27,838 --> 01:16:32,092
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have another appointment.

1047
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:36,263
You can finish out the week.

1048
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:45,606
Fuck!

1049
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:07,044
Good afternoon.

1050
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:09,463
It gives me
great pleasure to announce

1051
01:17:09,505 --> 01:17:11,757
that the Middlesex Ridge
School dance team

1052
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:13,884
has been invited to perform

1053
01:17:13,967 --> 01:17:16,345
on Ed McMahon's
"Star Search '88"

1054
01:17:16,386 --> 01:17:18,680
in Los Angeles, California.

1055
01:17:53,632 --> 01:17:56,677
No, it was ridiculous.
I'll call you back.

1056
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:01,056
- Rose.
- Kitty.

1057
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:05,394
I'm sure you're aware
of the horrible allegations

1058
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:06,979
against Jim Cunningham.

1059
01:18:07,062 --> 01:18:08,480
I know,
I saw it on TV.

1060
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:10,524
Something about a...
"kiddie porn dungeon."

1061
01:18:10,566 --> 01:18:13,986
Please, please.
Don't use those words!

1062
01:18:14,069 --> 01:18:16,905
It's obviously some kind
of conspiracy

1063
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:18,866
to destroy
an innocent man.

1064
01:18:18,949 --> 01:18:21,827
I have taken it upon myself
to spearhead

1065
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,871
the Jim Cunningham
defense campaign.

1066
01:18:25,789 --> 01:18:27,416
Rose...

1067
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:30,085
I have to appear at his arraignment
tomorrow morning.

1068
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:32,462
As you know, the girls
are scheduled to leave

1069
01:18:32,504 --> 01:18:34,298
for Los Angeles
in the morning.

1070
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:37,134
As their coach,
I was the obvious choice

1071
01:18:37,217 --> 01:18:38,844
to chaperone them
on their trip-

1072
01:18:38,927 --> 01:18:41,513
But now...
you can't go.

1073
01:18:41,597 --> 01:18:43,348
- Yes.
- Hmm.

1074
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:46,101
Believe me,
of all the other mothers,

1075
01:18:46,185 --> 01:18:48,479
I would never dream
of asking you.

1076
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,106
But none of the other mothers
are available to go.

1077
01:18:53,942 --> 01:18:55,819
I don't know, Kitty.

1078
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:59,031
It's a bad weekend.
Eddie's in New York.

1079
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:01,116
Rose!

1080
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:03,452
I don't know
if you realize

1081
01:19:03,494 --> 01:19:07,456
what an opportunity
this is for our daughters!

1082
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:09,666
This has been
a dream of Samantha's

1083
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,211
and all of ours
for a long time.

1084
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:16,548
I made her lead dancer!

1085
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:19,301
Sometimes I doubt
your commitment

1086
01:19:19,343 --> 01:19:21,345
to Sparkle Motion.

1087
01:19:51,583 --> 01:19:54,211
Elizabeth will be
in charge.

1088
01:19:54,294 --> 01:19:56,672
She'll drive you
to therapy.

1089
01:19:56,713 --> 01:19:59,716
If you need anything,
you promise me

1090
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,177
that you will call
Dr. Thurman?

1091
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:06,140
Okay.

1092
01:20:12,521 --> 01:20:15,607
How's it feel to have
a wacko for a son?

1093
01:20:21,155 --> 01:20:23,907
It feels wonderful.

1094
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:07,659
So what do I tell the other kids
when they ask about you?

1095
01:21:09,661 --> 01:21:12,581
Tell them that everything
is going to be just fine.

1096
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,085
What's "Cellar Door"?

1097
01:21:19,046 --> 01:21:20,964
This famous linguist
once said,

1098
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:24,593
that of all the phrases
in the English language...

1099
01:21:24,635 --> 01:21:27,179
of all the endless
combinations...

1100
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:29,139
of words
in all of history,

1101
01:21:29,223 --> 01:21:32,100
that "cellar door"
is the most beautiful.

1102
01:21:34,895 --> 01:21:36,855
"Cellar door"?

1103
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,806
I promise
that one day

1104
01:22:10,848 --> 01:22:12,975
everything's going
to be better for you.

1105
01:22:14,852 --> 01:22:17,354
Chut up!

1106
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:32,327
Dr. I want to talk
about your past today.

1107
01:22:32,369 --> 01:22:34,204
No.

1108
01:22:34,246 --> 01:22:37,749
Dr. I want to talk about...
you and your parents.

1109
01:22:38,876 --> 01:22:39,168
They didn't buy me

1110
01:22:39,168 --> 01:22:41,086
They didn't buy me

1111
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:42,671
what I wanted
for Christmas.

1112
01:22:42,754 --> 01:22:45,841
What did you want
for Christmas that year?

1113
01:22:46,925 --> 01:22:48,760
"Hungry, Hungry Hippos."

1114
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:53,307
How did you feel,

1115
01:22:53,390 --> 01:22:56,351
being denied
these "Hungry, Hungry Hippos"?

1116
01:22:56,435 --> 01:22:58,479
Regret.

1117
01:22:58,562 --> 01:23:01,190
What else
makes you feel regret?

1118
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:05,611
That I did it again.

1119
01:23:07,029 --> 01:23:08,697
You did it again?

1120
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:11,408
I flooded my school

1121
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:15,162
and I burned down
that pervert's house.

1122
01:23:17,206 --> 01:23:19,875
I only have a few days left
before they catch me.

1123
01:23:19,958 --> 01:23:22,419
Did Frank tell you
to do these things?

1124
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:25,422
I have to obey him.
He saved my life.

1125
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:30,093
I have to obey him
or I'll be left all alone.

1126
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:32,554
And then-

1127
01:23:32,596 --> 01:23:34,723
and then I won't be able
to figure out

1128
01:23:34,765 --> 01:23:36,767
what this is all about.

1129
01:23:36,809 --> 01:23:40,395
I won't be able
to know his master plan.

1130
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,191
Do you mean,
God's master plan?

1131
01:23:45,275 --> 01:23:48,070
Do you now
believe in God?

1132
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:50,739
I have the power to build
a time machine.

1133
01:23:50,781 --> 01:23:52,866
How is that possible?

1134
01:23:56,203 --> 01:23:58,205
How is time travel
possible?

1135
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:00,040
Donnie?

1136
01:24:00,123 --> 01:24:02,251
Time's up,
Frank said.

1137
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:04,628
When is this
going to happen?

1138
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:07,130
Soon.

1139
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:12,678
Soon.

1140
01:24:26,692 --> 01:24:29,069
What is going to happen?

1141
01:24:32,614 --> 01:24:35,117
Frank is going to kill.

1142
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:37,202
Who is he going to kill?

1143
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:43,458
Who is he going to kill, Donnie?

1144
01:24:43,542 --> 01:24:45,127
I can see him right now!

1145
01:24:49,423 --> 01:24:52,134
The sky is going
to open up.

1146
01:24:58,265 --> 01:25:01,560
If the sky were
to suddenly open up,

1147
01:25:01,602 --> 01:25:05,189
there would be no law.
There would be no rule.

1148
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:08,233
There would only be you
and your memories-

1149
01:25:08,317 --> 01:25:10,986
the choices you've made,

1150
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:13,238
and the people
you've touched.

1151
01:25:14,323 --> 01:25:16,241
If this world were to end,

1152
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:18,368
there would only be you...

1153
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:20,454
and him...

1154
01:25:20,537 --> 01:25:22,498
and no one else.

1155
01:26:00,285 --> 01:26:02,830
Hey.

1156
01:26:02,913 --> 01:26:04,623
I got in.

1157
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:10,796
I'm going to Harvard.

1158
01:26:13,006 --> 01:26:15,259
We should totally
throw a party.

1159
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,302
I mean,
Mom and Dad are gone.

1160
01:26:17,386 --> 01:26:20,305
It's Halloween Carnival.
We could get away with it.

1161
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:24,309
Okay, but it has to be
small, all right?

1162
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:27,020
- What do you guys got?
- Nothing good.

1163
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:29,398
Happy Halloween!

1164
01:26:56,133 --> 01:26:58,135
We got eggs,
water balloons

1165
01:26:58,218 --> 01:27:00,179
and a dozen rolls
of toilet paper.

1166
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:02,514
I stole four beers
from my dad.

1167
01:27:02,556 --> 01:27:06,143
- Well, we got a keg.
- Keg beer is for pussies.

1168
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:26,205
Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.

1169
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:28,707
It is extremely important
that you call me

1170
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,501
as soon as you get
this message.

1171
01:27:30,542 --> 01:27:32,044
Thank you.

1172
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:40,636
- Hi.
- Hey.

1173
01:27:44,389 --> 01:27:45,891
Are you okay?

1174
01:27:48,227 --> 01:27:50,062
Yeah, my mom's gone.

1175
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:54,024
You want to come in?

1176
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:55,651
Yeah.

1177
01:28:17,673 --> 01:28:19,383
I don't know, she...

1178
01:28:19,424 --> 01:28:22,302
she didn't leave a note

1179
01:28:22,386 --> 01:28:25,097
and the house
was all messed up.

1180
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:27,516
But you're okay?

1181
01:28:30,394 --> 01:28:33,021
Did you call the cops?

1182
01:28:33,105 --> 01:28:35,232
Yeah, they said I should
leave the house

1183
01:28:35,274 --> 01:28:38,861
and that I should go
to a safe place.

1184
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:42,406
I'm just so scared.

1185
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:44,449
I keep thinking
something awful

1186
01:28:44,491 --> 01:28:47,494
is happening, and...

1187
01:28:47,578 --> 01:28:50,664
it's my fucking stepdad,
I know it.

1188
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:02,593
I guess some people
are just born

1189
01:29:02,676 --> 01:29:04,761
with tragedy
in their blood.

1190
01:29:08,682 --> 01:29:10,726
Hey, have you guys
seen Frank?

1191
01:29:10,809 --> 01:29:12,769
No, I think they were going
on a beer run.

1192
01:29:12,853 --> 01:29:14,188
- Shit.

1193
01:29:16,273 --> 01:29:18,400
If you're there,
please pick up.

1194
01:29:18,484 --> 01:29:20,444
Oh, well.
Good news.

1195
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:22,488
The girls, they got
three and a half stars,

1196
01:29:22,529 --> 01:29:24,823
and they get to come back
for the quarterfinals.

1197
01:29:24,907 --> 01:29:28,744
It was amazing.
Anyway...

1198
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:32,122
we're going to take the red-eye
back tonight, and we ought to arrive-

1199
01:29:32,164 --> 01:29:33,832
Mom-
the plane's about to leave.

1200
01:29:33,916 --> 01:29:35,834
Okay, okay. We'll take
the red-eye back tonight.

1201
01:29:35,918 --> 01:29:39,129
We should arrive around
8:30 in the morning.

1202
01:29:39,171 --> 01:29:42,299
I hope everything's
all right.

1203
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:46,178
I love you. Bye.

1204
01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:50,182
...no private
consultation

1205
01:29:50,265 --> 01:29:54,019
Under the Milky Way
tonight

1206
01:29:57,397 --> 01:30:02,194
Wish I knew
what you were looking for

1207
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:08,367
Might have known
what you would find

1208
01:30:11,411 --> 01:30:14,998
And it's something
quite peculiar

1209
01:30:18,418 --> 01:30:22,297
Something shimmering
and white

1210
01:30:25,384 --> 01:30:27,469
It leads you here

1211
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:31,223
Despite
your destination

1212
01:30:32,641 --> 01:30:35,978
Under the Milky Way
tonight

1213
01:30:39,648 --> 01:30:44,027
Wish I knew
what you were looking for

1214
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:50,075
Might have known
what you would find

1215
01:30:54,163 --> 01:30:58,917
Wish I knew
what you were looking for

1216
01:31:00,752 --> 01:31:04,298
Might have known
what you would find

1217
01:31:30,991 --> 01:31:32,910
"...the cellar door..."

1218
01:31:36,330 --> 01:31:40,209
And it's something
quite peculiar...

1219
01:31:40,292 --> 01:31:43,045
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

1220
01:31:43,128 --> 01:31:45,881
- Donnie.
- Look, we gotta go.

1221
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:48,842
- Where?
- You ever see Grandma Death?

1222
01:31:48,926 --> 01:31:50,803
Why, is this about the book?

1223
01:31:50,844 --> 01:31:52,387
- No, it's Frank.
- Donnie-

1224
01:31:52,471 --> 01:31:54,389
Time is running out!
We gotta go.

1225
01:32:25,462 --> 01:32:28,048
Roberta Sparrow.

1226
01:32:29,383 --> 01:32:31,635
Grandma Death.

1227
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:43,564
Donnie, nobody's here.
Let's just forget about it.

1228
01:32:45,482 --> 01:32:47,776
Huh-
"Cellar door."

1229
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:49,403
What?

1230
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:53,050
Oh, my God!
Donnie! Donnie!

1231
01:33:57,179 --> 01:33:58,847
Donnie-!

1232
01:33:59,973 --> 01:34:01,975
Why the fuck
are you here?!

1233
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:03,477
Oh, my God!

1234
01:34:06,814 --> 01:34:08,273
You're dead!

1235
01:34:08,357 --> 01:34:09,566
What are we doing?

1236
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:11,485
- Shit!
- Leave him alone!

1237
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:17,366
Don't fucking move!
Don't fucking move!

1238
01:34:19,326 --> 01:34:21,453
Fuck!

1239
01:34:26,458 --> 01:34:29,711
- There's a car.

1240
01:34:29,795 --> 01:34:31,547
Get the hell
out of here. Now!

1241
01:34:33,132 --> 01:34:35,551
Seth, there's
a car coming. Let's go!

1242
01:34:35,634 --> 01:34:37,886
I have a bigger
knife now.

1243
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:43,892
Let's go!
He called the cops!

1244
01:34:47,437 --> 01:34:48,981
Did you call
the fucking cops?!

1245
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:52,818
- Deus ex machina.
- What did you just say?

1246
01:34:55,195 --> 01:34:57,823
- What the fuck did you just say?
- Our savior.

1247
01:35:02,411 --> 01:35:04,371
Donnie!

1248
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:18,469
Gretchen...?

1249
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:24,516
Gretchen...?

1250
01:35:26,435 --> 01:35:28,020
Gretchen.

1251
01:35:31,940 --> 01:35:34,109
Wake up, Gretchen.

1252
01:35:34,193 --> 01:35:36,695
- Frank...
- Wake up.

1253
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:38,697
What did you do?

1254
01:35:40,741 --> 01:35:43,744
Gretchen,
wake up. Wake up.

1255
01:35:43,785 --> 01:35:45,662
Wake up.

1256
01:35:48,081 --> 01:35:49,958
Gretchen...

1257
01:35:50,042 --> 01:35:51,919
Gretchen...

1258
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:54,463
What the fuck
did you do, man?

1259
01:35:55,964 --> 01:35:57,925
You killed her,
Frank!

1260
01:36:01,428 --> 01:36:03,222
Is she dead?

1261
01:36:10,938 --> 01:36:14,274
What were you guys doing
in the middle of the road?!

1262
01:36:14,358 --> 01:36:15,984
What are you thinking?!

1263
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:25,911
Go home.

1264
01:36:25,953 --> 01:36:28,372
Go home and tell your parents
everything will be okay.

1265
01:36:30,207 --> 01:36:31,834
Go!

1266
01:38:38,168 --> 01:38:40,462
28 days...

1267
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:43,674
Six hours...

1268
01:38:43,757 --> 01:38:47,386
42 minutes...

1269
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:49,805
12 seconds.

1270
01:38:53,308 --> 01:38:55,561
I'm going home.

1271
01:39:13,871 --> 01:39:16,415
So in order
to travel back in time,

1272
01:39:16,498 --> 01:39:18,876
you have to have a big spaceship
or something that can travel

1273
01:39:18,959 --> 01:39:21,336
- faster than the speed of light?
- Dr. Theoretically.

1274
01:39:21,378 --> 01:39:23,213
And be able to find
one of these wormholes?

1275
01:39:23,297 --> 01:39:25,382
Dr. The basic principles
of time travel are there.

1276
01:39:25,466 --> 01:39:27,801
You've got your vessel
and your portal.

1277
01:39:27,843 --> 01:39:29,720
And your vessel could be
just about anything,

1278
01:39:29,803 --> 01:39:32,055
most likely a spacecraft.

1279
01:39:32,139 --> 01:39:34,308
Metal craft of any kind.

1280
01:39:46,987 --> 01:39:48,906
What if you
could go back in time

1281
01:39:48,989 --> 01:39:51,450
and take those hours
of pain and darkness

1282
01:39:51,533 --> 01:39:54,286
and replace them
with something better?

1283
01:40:38,121 --> 01:40:40,833
"Dear Roberta Sparrow,

1284
01:40:40,916 --> 01:40:43,585
I've reached you
in your book,

1285
01:40:43,669 --> 01:40:45,963
but there's so many things
I need to ask you.

1286
01:40:47,089 --> 01:40:49,550
Sometimes I'm afraid
of what you might tell me.

1287
01:40:54,972 --> 01:40:56,682
Sometimes I'm afraid
that you'll tell me

1288
01:40:56,765 --> 01:40:58,350
this is not a work
of fiction.

1289
01:40:59,601 --> 01:41:02,437
I can only hope
that the answers

1290
01:41:02,521 --> 01:41:05,274
will come to me
in my sleep.

1291
01:41:05,357 --> 01:41:07,609
I hope that when
the world comes to an end,

1292
01:41:07,693 --> 01:41:10,279
I can breathe
a sigh of relief,

1293
01:41:10,362 --> 01:41:14,575
because there will be
so much to look forward to."

1294
01:43:00,681 --> 01:43:04,852
All around me
are familiar faces

1295
01:43:04,935 --> 01:43:08,021
Worn out places

1296
01:43:08,063 --> 01:43:11,400
Worn out faces

1297
01:43:11,441 --> 01:43:15,988
Bright and early
for their daily races

1298
01:43:16,071 --> 01:43:19,032
Going nowhere

1299
01:43:19,074 --> 01:43:22,828
Going nowhere

1300
01:43:22,911 --> 01:43:27,040
Their tears are filling up
their glasses

1301
01:43:27,082 --> 01:43:29,793
No expression

1302
01:43:29,877 --> 01:43:33,338
No expression

1303
01:43:33,422 --> 01:43:38,218
Hide my head,
I want to drown my sorrow

1304
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:41,221
No tomorrow

1305
01:43:41,263 --> 01:43:44,975
No tomorrow

1306
01:43:45,058 --> 01:43:48,103
And I find it kind of funny

1307
01:43:48,145 --> 01:43:50,522
I find it kind of sad

1308
01:43:50,606 --> 01:43:53,066
The dreams in which I'm dying

1309
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:55,777
Are the best I've ever had

1310
01:43:55,819 --> 01:43:59,239
I find it hard to tell you

1311
01:43:59,323 --> 01:44:01,700
I find it hard to take

1312
01:44:01,783 --> 01:44:04,286
When people run in circles

1313
01:44:04,369 --> 01:44:06,955
It's a very, very...

1314
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:10,501
Mad world

1315
01:44:13,003 --> 01:44:15,964
Mad world

1316
01:44:17,758 --> 01:44:22,262
Children waiting
for the day they feel good

1317
01:44:22,346 --> 01:44:25,390
Happy birthday

1318
01:44:25,474 --> 01:44:28,727
Happy birthday

1319
01:44:28,811 --> 01:44:33,482
Made to feel the way
that every child should

1320
01:44:33,565 --> 01:44:35,859
Sit and listen

1321
01:44:35,943 --> 01:44:40,113
Sit and listen

1322
01:44:40,197 --> 01:44:44,493
Went to school
and I was very nervous

1323
01:44:44,535 --> 01:44:47,454
No one knew me

1324
01:44:47,538 --> 01:44:50,457
No one knew me

1325
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:55,379
Hello, teacher,
tell me, what's my lesson?

1326
01:44:55,420 --> 01:44:58,215
Look right through me

1327
01:44:58,298 --> 01:45:02,010
Look right through me

1328
01:45:02,052 --> 01:45:05,180
And I find it kind of funny

1329
01:45:05,264 --> 01:45:07,850
I find it kind of sad

1330
01:45:07,933 --> 01:45:10,644
The dreams in which I'm dying

1331
01:45:10,727 --> 01:45:13,355
Are the best I've ever had

1332
01:45:13,397 --> 01:45:16,191
I find it hard to tell you

1333
01:45:16,275 --> 01:45:18,735
I find it hard to take

1334
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:21,697
When people run in circles

1335
01:45:21,738 --> 01:45:24,575
It's a very, very...

1336
01:45:24,658 --> 01:45:27,452
Mad world

1337
01:45:30,330 --> 01:45:33,208
Mad world

1338
01:45:35,377 --> 01:45:38,714
Enlarged in your world

1339
01:45:41,383 --> 01:45:45,137
Mad world.

1340
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:46,972
Hey...

1341
01:45:47,055 --> 01:45:49,224
what's going on?

1342
01:45:49,308 --> 01:45:51,351
Horrible accident.

1343
01:45:51,435 --> 01:45:52,978
My neighbor...

1344
01:45:53,061 --> 01:45:54,813
got killed.

1345
01:45:54,897 --> 01:45:57,441
What happened?

1346
01:45:57,524 --> 01:45:59,693
Got smooshed
by a jet engine.

1347
01:46:05,324 --> 01:46:07,534
What was his name?

1348
01:46:07,618 --> 01:46:10,454
Donnie.
Donnie Darko.

1349
01:46:12,372 --> 01:46:14,583
I feel bad
for his family.

1350
01:46:16,126 --> 01:46:17,544
Yeah.

1351
01:46:24,676 --> 01:46:26,678
Did you know him?

1352
01:46:29,681 --> 01:46:31,642
No.

1353
01:46:54,331 --> 01:46:56,875
...switch back to base.

1354
01:46:56,959 --> 01:47:00,045
All units should be
back on base frequency.
