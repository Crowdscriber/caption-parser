MAN (drunkenly):
♪ Meet you all the way

2
00:00:05,781 --> 00:00:07,248
♪ Yeah, ah

3
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:09,167
(humming)

4
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:11,286
♪ Take you all the way

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,954
♪ Do-do-do

♪ Oh, yeah...
Seriously.

12
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:28,436
Toto is amazing.
Toto sucktitude.

13
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,657
I will not argue
about this, bro.

14
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:32,724
Toto is amazeballs.

15
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:35,977
Shut up about your incredibly
gay crush on your incredibly

16
00:00:36,062 --> 00:00:37,479
gay band and get over it.
(scat singing)

17
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:39,263
Seriously. Kyle,
what are you gonna get?

18
00:00:39,315 --> 00:00:41,566
Look, check mine out.

19
00:00:41,617 --> 00:00:43,601
I see.

20
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,653
It means "Beginning and End."

21
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:47,572
You know, dude,
most of those don't even mean

22
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:49,541
what the chart
on the wall says they mean.

23
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:52,377
You might have "I'm a freaking
idiot" on your leg right now.

24
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:54,712
(laughter) Seriously. You're
going to go out for Chinese food

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,215
in a pair of shorts, and the
whole wait staff is gonna be

26
00:00:57,282 --> 00:00:59,717
laughing their
asses off at you.

27
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,252
BILLY: What the hell does
"Beginning and End" mean,

28
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,670
even if that is what it says?

29
00:01:02,755 --> 00:01:04,139
JIM:
It's my life philosophy.

30
00:01:04,223 --> 00:01:06,724
It means, live
right goddamn now.

31
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,676
You're full of shit.

32
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,395
(laughter)

33
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:13,398
Yeah, seriously,
Kyle, get something.

34
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,133
No, dude. My mom would kill me.
Oh, it's cool.

35
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:16,851
Oh, I'd totally bang her
to take her mind off of it.

36
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:20,738
(laughs)

37
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:22,407
Oh, I got plans.

38
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:24,642
I'm not going to grow up
and work for Daddy,

39
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:26,911
or sell pot
to undergrads all my life.

40
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:29,581
You guys know why the levees
broke during Katrina?

41
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:32,316
'Cause the little Dutch boy
ran out of fingers?

42
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:35,086
The levees were built by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

43
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:36,704
But they built them for shit.

44
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,206
And where I'm from
still hasn't recovered,

45
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,624
and probably never will.

46
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:41,325
BILLY:
What in the hell

47
00:01:41,377 --> 00:01:43,661
does you getting a tattoo have
to do with Katrina?

48
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:45,597
I'm going to be an engineer.

49
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:48,933
And I'm going to make sure shit
like that never happens again.

50
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,936
I don't want to walk
into some big meeting

51
00:01:52,004 --> 00:01:53,771
with a mayor or a governor
and roll up my sleeves

52
00:01:53,839 --> 00:01:56,841
and have a little Saints logo
or a... or a Wile E. Coyote

53
00:01:56,892 --> 00:01:58,693
or anything
that's gonna make him think

54
00:01:58,777 --> 00:02:01,029
that I'm anything other than
his knight in shining armor.

55
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:04,282
I got one life,
and I'm not wasting it.

56
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,950
I think
it's a pretty cool idea, Kyle.

57
00:02:06,018 --> 00:02:07,152
Thank you, Jimmy.

58
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:09,020
Thank you.
Yeah, I do, too.

59
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:10,855
That's why I want to wish you
the luck of the Irish.

60
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:12,657
I didn't know you were Irish.
I'm not.

61
00:02:12,708 --> 00:02:13,741
You can't drink or fight.
You're a little bitch.

62
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:15,293
It looks good, right?

63
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,662

80
00:04:19,568 --> 00:04:24,038
<i>We are known for our</i>
<i>entitlement and narcissism.</i>

81
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:26,207
<i>Some say it's because</i>
<i>we're the first generation</i>

82
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:28,743
<i>where every kid gets a trophy</i>
<i>just for showing up.</i>

83
00:04:28,794 --> 00:04:31,078
<i>Others think it's because</i>
<i>social media allows us</i>

84
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,247
<i>to post every time we fart</i>

<i>for all the world to see.</i>

86
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,051
<i>But it seems</i>
<i>that our one defining trait</i>

87
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,753
<i>is a numbness to the world,</i>

88
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:40,888
<i>an indifference to suffering.</i>

89

<i>I know I did anything</i>

<i>Take away my mother and</i>

<i>Most people never get over</i>
<i>stuff like that,</i>

97
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:04,796
<i>and I was, like,</i>
<i>"Let's go for Jamba Juice."</i>

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,965
<i>I would give everything</i>
<i>I have or will ever have</i>

99
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,967
<i>just to feel pain again,</i>
<i>to hurt.</i>

100

<i>Thank God for Minor League</i>
<i>Fiona and her herb garden.</i>

<i>that I thought made my nipples</i>
<i>tingle for a second,</i>

105
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,481
<i>but I think</i>
<i>it was psychosomatic,</i>

106
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:26,467
<i>because I polished off the rest</i>
<i>of it and didn't feel shit.</i>

107
00:05:26,518 --> 00:05:28,302
<i>I tried every eye of newt</i>

112
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:44,752
<i>I can't feel shit.</i>

113
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,538
<i>I can't feel anything.</i>

114

118
00:05:59,635 --> 00:06:01,302
<i>I used to not eat for days.</i>

119

<i>Or eat like crazy, and then</i>

120

You were a great guy, Kyle.

133
00:06:35,254 --> 00:06:37,538
But you died.

134

(gasps)
It's new.

138
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:47,982
I used it to bring you back.

00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:51,435
(crying)

140
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,822
You killed your mother, Kyle.

00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:56,968
Ain't no self-respecting rat
gonna live here.

160
00:07:57,052 --> 00:07:58,502
Ain't nothin' to eat.

161
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:02,590
Nonsense. These larders
are bursting to full.

162
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,063
Well, that is disappointing.

163
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,568
I was feeling
a tad peckish myself.

164
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:17,471
MAN: Welcome to Jumpin' Jacks.
May I take your order?

165
00:08:17,522 --> 00:08:21,141
Who said that?
Girl, relax. It's just a guy at the window.

166
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:24,946
Let me get two Jumpin' Jacks
with cheese, two fries,

167
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:27,498
large, and two
strawberry cyclones.

168
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,543
Would you care to super size
your order for $1.99?

169
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:32,003
Do we dare?

170
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:33,454
(laughs)

171
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:35,039
Hell, yeah!

172
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:40,177
Lord in heaven, the
most delicious food

173
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:42,830
I have eaten in my entire life!

174
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,682
And that's saying something.

175
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,350
(laughs)
I know, right?

176
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:48,970
I'm starting to understand
why you're so enormous.

177
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,855
You're not exactly
svelte yourself, okay?

178
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,607
I didn't mean to give offense.

179
00:08:52,674 --> 00:08:54,025
Yeah, but you do, Miss Daisy.

180
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,393
All the damn time.

181
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:57,144
It's this century.

182
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:59,614
It still does perplex me so.

183
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:01,015
You think I'm any
less perplexed?

184
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:02,700
I dragged my ass

185
00:09:02,784 --> 00:09:04,285
all the way here from Detroit

186
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:06,704
to be with my, quote,
"sister witches."

187
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:10,458
And instead, I'm sitting
in a fast-food parking lot

188
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:12,994
at 3:00 in the morning
with an immortal racist.

189
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:14,378
(laughs)

190
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:16,213
How did that happen?

191
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:20,301
Those girls-- they're never
gonna see you as their sister.

192
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:22,470
Let me guess.
'Cause I'm fat?

193
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:24,171
No, ma chère.

194
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:26,007
'Cause you're black.

195
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,475
Black as coal.

196
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:32,546
(phone ringing)

197
00:09:36,068 --> 00:09:38,385
Hello?

198
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:40,488
Shit. It's late.

199
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:42,323
Hank.

200
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,492
I miss you, baby.
I want to come home.

201
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,777
Go to bed, Hank.

202
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:51,899
I'll see you soon, baby.

203
00:10:00,926 --> 00:10:03,243
CORDELIA:
Delphine?

204
00:10:03,295 --> 00:10:05,513
Delphine?

205
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:18,859
Delphine?
(soft thudding)

206
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:20,778
(footsteps)

207
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:23,147
Spalding?

208
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:27,034
Who is it?

209
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,103
I know you're there.

210
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:34,742
Whoa! Whoa! Hold it there!
Madison.

211
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:35,876
MADISON:
<i>Stop yelling at me!</i>

212
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:37,712
Do it! Do it! Do it!
(screaming)

213
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,080
(gasps)
(gasps)

214
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:39,780
Oh, my God.

215
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,166
(gasps loudly)

216
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:45,836
Fiona.

217
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:02,937
I wasn't expecting company.

218
00:11:02,988 --> 00:11:04,905
I wasn't expecting
Buckingham Palace.

219
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:06,657
A woman like yourself

220
00:11:06,742 --> 00:11:10,194
deserves to be surrounded
by beauty and grace.

221
00:11:15,316 --> 00:11:17,535
(jazz plays)

222
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:27,327
Sit down.

223
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:39,473
All I have to offer
is some decent bourbon,

224
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,225
and hopefully, good company.

225
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,289
The reason for living
was to get ready

226
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:56,857
to stay dead a long time.

227
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:58,542
Faulkner.

228
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:01,045
<i>As I Lay Dying.</i>

229
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,580
I get it.

230
00:12:02,664 --> 00:12:04,698
You're not just any old

231
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,584
broke-down sax man,

232
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:08,502
you're a college-educated one.

233
00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,588
I've led a...

234
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:12,306
solitary life.

235
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:13,724
(laughs)

236
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:15,542
Come on, you don't
really expect me

237
00:12:15,594 --> 00:12:17,211
to believe that.

238
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:19,897
You know, when I was coming up
in the clubs, uh...

239
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:21,932
musicians weren't so respected.

240
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,517
Hmm.
They were considered, uh,

241
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,736
poor, indigent,

242
00:12:25,821 --> 00:12:27,404
and had to be content, uh,

243
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:28,689
being the
back-door man...

244
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,058
never invited
to stay the night.

245
00:12:31,109 --> 00:12:32,660
It's more dangerous that way.

246
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:34,578
Yeah.

247
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:37,832
And you like danger.

248
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,116
I can tell that about you.

249
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:41,785
And I like it.

250
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:46,240
Who's he?

251
00:12:48,927 --> 00:12:50,377
We call him Prince.

252
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:52,630
Prince of the Ivories.

253
00:13:05,443 --> 00:13:07,228
I hope you understand, Fiona,

254
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,779
that this is a...

255
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:11,365
a rare night, uh,

256
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,433
a celestial creature
like yourself, uh...

257
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:16,704
gracing this humble abode.

258
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:19,106
In short...

259
00:13:19,157 --> 00:13:20,908
hot damn.

260
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,493
(both laughing)

261
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,300
You're gonna have
to excuse me a minute.

262
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:30,834
It's not very
inviting in there.

263
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,002
Yeah.

264
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:37,675
Ugh...

265
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,070
AXEMAN:
Another bourbon?

266
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:54,358
Absolutely.

267
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,331
AXEMAN: Is the bourbon
smooth enough?

268
00:14:22,382 --> 00:14:23,567
(chuckles)

269
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:25,801
Women don't usually
like a harsh whiskey.

270
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:27,436
Well, never assume
anything about me.

271
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:30,222
My taste in whiskey,
or... men.

272
00:14:31,391 --> 00:14:33,359
May I assume...

273
00:14:33,443 --> 00:14:34,510
that you'd like to kiss me?

274
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:50,576
(whispering):
This was a mistake.

275
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:52,244
I ran out of sleeping pills.

276
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:53,913
It was a bad idea.
Don't go.

277
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:56,048
This is not just
a one-night stand.

278
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:58,534
That is exactly what it is:

279
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,635
a one-night stand.

280
00:15:01,638 --> 00:15:02,805
It could be our destiny.

281
00:15:02,872 --> 00:15:04,423
(laughing):
No...

282
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:10,062
Do you actually think
my destiny is here

283
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:12,231
in this roach-infested
shithole?

284
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:14,483
Well, life is full
of surprises.

285
00:15:14,551 --> 00:15:15,568
Well, I've had enough surprises

286
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,186
for two lifetimes.

287
00:15:17,237 --> 00:15:18,904
I'm through with surprises.

288
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,823
Were you surprised
that you wanted to kiss me?

289
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,997
Oh...

290
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:31,400
No, you don't want
anything to do with me.

291
00:15:31,451 --> 00:15:35,004
I am a wretched human being.

292
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:36,872
A miserable, mean
goddamn bitch,

293
00:15:36,923 --> 00:15:38,574
I always have been.

294
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,626
I've had three husbands.

295
00:15:40,711 --> 00:15:42,762
I've destroyed every
decent relationship

296
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:44,714
I have ever had,

297
00:15:44,765 --> 00:15:46,582
including one with my daughter.

298
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:48,718
Love transforms.

299
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:50,219
Come on, you don't
believe in love.

300
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,887
Okay, let's table love, then.

301
00:15:51,938 --> 00:15:54,807
What about sex?

302
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:59,261
Good, old-fashioned,
great sex.

303
00:15:59,312 --> 00:16:02,448
(laughs)

304
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,567
You know, that's why
I took up the saxophone.

305
00:16:04,618 --> 00:16:07,036
You really are
good with the ladies.

306
00:16:07,103 --> 00:16:08,154
Oh, I'm good.
(laughs)

307
00:16:09,956 --> 00:16:11,457
The joke was

308
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,793
they always watched
the bass player.

309
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:16,746
But they should've
watched my fingers

310
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:18,631
on the keys...

311
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:19,948
(giggles)

312
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,501
(playing jazz melody)

313
00:16:24,221 --> 00:16:25,971
...my body in perfect
synchronization...

314
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:28,674
(laughing)

315
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,126
...an extension of
my instrument...

316
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:32,478
(plays low notes)

317
00:16:32,562 --> 00:16:33,813
<i>...no effort at all,</i>

318
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:35,848
<i>just one with it.</i>

319
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:40,986
<i>The way my lips and tongue</i>

320
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,192
<i>wrapped around my instrument</i>

321
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:45,274
<i>was... impeccable.</i>

322
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:46,992
My embouchure...

323
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:48,194
(laughing)

324
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:50,529
<i>...that's how I calibrate,</i>

325
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:53,866
hit those clear, high notes.

326
00:16:56,036 --> 00:16:57,036
(playing upbeat jazz)

327
00:17:12,335 --> 00:17:14,220
(Fiona laughing)

328
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,389
(grunts)

329
00:17:19,142 --> 00:17:22,228
I want to trust you, Kyle.

330
00:17:24,314 --> 00:17:26,348
You need to learn
how to communicate.

331
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:27,650
When you're hungry,

332
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,652
when you're tired, when...

333
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:31,504
when you feel like you
might do something bad.

334
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,906
When you're hungry,

335
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,408
I want you to say
"food."

336
00:17:39,412 --> 00:17:41,413
"Food."

337
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:43,365
Food.

338
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,501
Good.

339
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:47,586
When you're tired,
you can say...

340
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:49,371
you can say "bed."

341
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:51,807
Not!

342
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:54,093
S...

343
00:17:55,879 --> 00:17:57,713
stupid.

344
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,266
I know you're not.

345
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,601
You're not stupid.
Mm-mm.

346
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:04,904
Everything you know, it...

347
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,405
it's stuck in your head.

348
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,407
I'm trying to help you,

349
00:18:08,492 --> 00:18:10,559
so you can function
like a person.

350
00:18:27,794 --> 00:18:28,844
(screams)

351
00:18:28,912 --> 00:18:31,246
No!
Stop. Shh.

352
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:33,465
(grunting, shouting)

353
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:36,919
Jesus, who's this?

354
00:18:40,857 --> 00:18:42,725
Don't you remember?

355
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:44,610
It's Kyle.

356
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:47,396
We used a spell,
brought him back to life?

357
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,765
You killed him.

358
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:55,437
Oh, uh... Cordelia
wants to see you.

359
00:18:55,488 --> 00:18:56,705
Uh, actually,

360
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:58,040
that would be impossible,

361
00:18:58,107 --> 00:18:59,408
but she does want to talk.

362
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:00,442
She knows you're alive?

363
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:01,410
She knows a lot more

364
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:02,611
than you think.

365
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:04,496
Go. I'll take care of him.

366
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,343
Huh?

367
00:19:24,985 --> 00:19:28,904
Looks like we had
to put you back together.

368
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:31,023
Lucky I picked out
all the best pieces.

369
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:33,475
(shouts)

370
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:34,910
(yells)

371
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,651
You were dead.

372
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,536
So was I.

373
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,041
I didn't see a light, did you?

374
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:52,044
Mine was cold

375
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:53,345
and dark...

376
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,931
and then nothing.

377
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:58,166
But we both came back.

378
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:00,936
To this.

379
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:03,105
Somehow, it feels
more empty here.

380
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:08,010
You know exactly how I feel.

381
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:10,029
(sniffs)

382
00:20:10,113 --> 00:20:12,114
You've been wondering if
it was worth the trouble.

383
00:20:17,687 --> 00:20:20,456
And I've been
wondering the same thing.

384
00:20:28,415 --> 00:20:30,633
(sniffling)

385
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,713
♪ You say you're leavin'

386
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:46,098
♪ Won't be back no more

387
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:47,483
LAVEAU:
Here, Walter.

388
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,734
You got some good
ones for me today?

389
00:20:48,818 --> 00:20:50,719
(chuckles)

390
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,688
Ooh...

391
00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:54,990
Yeah... give me
three of them.

392
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:56,492
(laughs)

393
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,160
Are you gonna come in?

394
00:20:58,227 --> 00:21:01,363
Or you just gonna stare
from the doorway, Queenie?

395
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:03,365
How do you know my name?

396
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,918
Black witch come to town,
I'm gonna hear about it.

397
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:08,704
Surprised it took you this long
to come see me.

398
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:11,239
You doin' some kind of
voodoo with them fish heads?

399
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,541
It's Sunday night.

400
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:14,076
I'm makin' gumbo.

401
00:21:14,127 --> 00:21:15,928
♪ You have somebody else

402
00:21:16,012 --> 00:21:18,246

Not surprised.

404
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:22,417
Livin' over there
in wonder bread land.

405
00:21:22,469 --> 00:21:24,419
They probably feed you
Shake 'n Bake

406
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:26,355
and watermelon for dessert.

407
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:27,940
Hmph.

408
00:21:28,024 --> 00:21:29,858
They don't care that I'm black.

409
00:21:29,926 --> 00:21:32,561
I just think that...
they just don't like me.

410
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:35,764
Oh... they care plenty.

411
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:37,265
Hmph.

412
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:39,034
Their power is built

413
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:40,953
on the sweat of our backs.

414
00:21:41,037 --> 00:21:43,238
The only reason you
and I in this country

415
00:21:43,289 --> 00:21:44,540
is 'cause our
great-great-grandpas

416
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,792
couldn't run fast enough.

417
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:48,744
We'll never be welcome here.

418
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:52,498
And those witches
are the worst.

419
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,621
They're not so bad.

420
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:00,789
No?

421
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,391
Even right now,

422
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,792
they got evil sleeping
under their roof,

423
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:05,928
eatin' alongside of 'em.

424
00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:07,730
I locked that horror in a box

425
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:09,297
and buried her in the ground.

426
00:22:09,349 --> 00:22:10,899
Fiona Goode digs her up,

427
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,602
gives her a warm bed
and three meals a day.

428
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:15,821
Delphine?

429
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:17,606
Fiona made her my slave.

430
00:22:17,657 --> 00:22:19,691
Slave's too good for her.

431
00:22:19,776 --> 00:22:21,476
You heard the stories,
I'm sure.

432
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:23,746
That ain't the half of it.

433
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:25,313
Ask her what she done.

434
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:26,498
You ask her.

435
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,617
Then you see.

436
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:30,502
You want to come live with us?

437
00:22:30,587 --> 00:22:32,955
With your own people?

438
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,924
The price of admission

439
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:38,827
is Madame Delphine LaLaurie.

440
00:22:38,878 --> 00:22:40,345
Bring her to me,

441
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,830
and you will have a home.

442
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:46,334
I never said I wanted
to come join you.

443
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:49,438
Voodoo doll belong
in the house of voodoo.

444
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:51,673
And I know you didn't
cross the line

445
00:22:51,724 --> 00:22:53,609
and break the truce
for no bowl of gumbo.

446
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,844
Every man, woman
and child in this house

447
00:22:55,895 --> 00:22:57,196
know what it feel like

448
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,947
to have to live as second best

449
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:00,949
to some pretty
little white girl.

450
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:02,868
You come here,

451
00:23:02,952 --> 00:23:05,487
and you ain't never got
to feel that way again.

452
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:07,956
More than that,

453
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:12,027
you mix your witch
with our voodoo...

454
00:23:12,078 --> 00:23:15,080
and even the Supreme
won't be able to touch you.

455
00:23:22,205 --> 00:23:24,423
I should get back.

456
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:30,896
What are you gonna do to her?

457
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,982
If I bring Delphine to you?

458
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,652
Oh, don't you worry
about that, child.

459
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,986
Now you just get you home

460
00:23:38,054 --> 00:23:39,888
'fore it get dark.

461
00:23:50,783 --> 00:23:52,951
(liquid bubbling)

462
00:23:56,956 --> 00:23:58,507
You go into the hospital,

463
00:23:58,574 --> 00:24:00,575
and you wonder if you'll
ever come out again.

464
00:24:00,627 --> 00:24:03,078
You come out, and you wonder,

465
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:06,298
"Goddamn, what have I been
doing all these years?"

466
00:24:07,517 --> 00:24:08,917
Tea?

467
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:09,685
No, thank you.

468
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:14,640
I would say everything
is different now...

469
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:18,694
but it's not.

470
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:21,864
Everything around here
is exactly the same.

471
00:24:21,931 --> 00:24:24,599
Only difference is...

472
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:25,984
now I see it.

473
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,239
The Axeman was a bad spirit.

474
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,957
You not only brought him here,

475
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:33,625
you sent him packing,

476
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,547
which means you are one
hot shit witch.

477
00:24:38,614 --> 00:24:42,450
Power like yours does not go
unnoticed.

478
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:45,220
Which means you've got a
bull's-eye on your back, kiddo,

479
00:24:45,288 --> 00:24:49,725
and our biggest enemy is locked,
loaded, and looking at you.

480
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:53,461
Marie Laveau.

481
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:54,596
My mother.

482
00:24:54,647 --> 00:24:56,965
But she's on our side.

483
00:24:57,016 --> 00:25:00,819
Fiona Goode has been on the same
side her whole life: her own.

484
00:25:00,904 --> 00:25:02,404
Now, I don't know

485
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:06,241
if you are the next Supreme,
nobody does,

486
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:09,578
but if she jumps to that
conclusion, right or wrong,

487
00:25:09,645 --> 00:25:11,813
she will slit your throat

488
00:25:11,864 --> 00:25:13,481
just like she did to Madison.

489
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:16,818
Nobody knows who killed Madison,
not even Madison.

490
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:19,087
She doesn't, but I do.

491
00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:21,924
My mother killed her
because she thought

492
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:23,675
Madison was the next leader
of our coven.

493
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,880
She wanted to absorb
her power, her life force.

494
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:36,021
So if she even thinks
you're next...

495
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:37,272
you're next.

496
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:42,811
Holy shit.

497
00:25:42,862 --> 00:25:44,179
Right?

498
00:25:47,567 --> 00:25:50,152
Fiona is fading, growing weaker.

499
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:54,206
Which only makes her
more dangerous.

500
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,024
A wounded animal
will rip you apart

501
00:25:56,075 --> 00:25:58,961
if it's cornered.

502
00:25:59,028 --> 00:26:01,246
So what do we do?

503
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,835
It's simple.

504
00:26:06,886 --> 00:26:09,588
We're going to kill my mother.

505
00:26:09,672 --> 00:26:12,758
Kill her once, kill her good,

506
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:14,977
kill her dead.

507
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:27,489
(Kyle grunting)

508
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:42,403
Where do you think
you're going?

509
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,961
We've only just begun.

510
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:52,104
(chuckles)

511
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:54,073
You know, it was
a charming evening,

512
00:26:54,157 --> 00:26:58,628
but, uh, that dead body
in your bathtub

513
00:26:58,695 --> 00:27:01,914
is going to start putting off
some very noxious odors soon.

514
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:04,834
Just a few fumes.

515
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:06,335
You're no angel.

516
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:07,420
(chuckles)

517
00:27:09,473 --> 00:27:11,390
Although you always
did have someone

518
00:27:11,475 --> 00:27:13,709
tidy up after you, didn't you?

519
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:20,850
It was fun,
our little romantic game,

520
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,685
but I've called the police,

521
00:27:22,736 --> 00:27:24,487
and they're gonna
be coming shortly.

522
00:27:24,554 --> 00:27:25,855
Oh, you'd never do that.

523
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:28,274
You hate the coppers.

524
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:30,943
We're one and the same,
you and me.

525
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:35,581
When was the last time

526
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:37,066
that your body made
a light show,

527
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:38,668
huh?

528
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:42,622
My guess is never.

529
00:27:46,793 --> 00:27:49,629
You're afraid.

530
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:53,248
You're afraid
of your own pleasure.

531
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,751
It makes you feel weak,

532
00:27:55,802 --> 00:27:59,055
like you need somebody.
That's why you're going.

533
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:01,941
You're drawing
ridiculous conclusions.

534
00:28:02,025 --> 00:28:03,559
I don't even know your name

535
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,860
and I don't care to.

536
00:28:08,315 --> 00:28:10,791
You don't know me,

537
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:13,369
but there's nothing
I don't know about you.

538
00:28:13,436 --> 00:28:17,039
Your secrets, your dreams,
everything.

539
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:20,943
I've been watching over you
since you were eight years old.

540
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:39,795
You think you're special,
little witch?

541
00:28:39,846 --> 00:28:41,296
What's your name?

542
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:42,765
Fiona Goode.

543
00:28:42,816 --> 00:28:44,183
Do you know what happens

544
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:45,735
to scrawny little girls

545
00:28:45,802 --> 00:28:47,570
who stick their heads
up above the others?

546
00:28:47,637 --> 00:28:48,854
They get it chopped off.

547
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:50,239
I'm not afraid of you, Helen.

548
00:28:53,076 --> 00:28:54,143
Pick it up.

549
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:02,368
Now hold the glass
above your head.

550
00:29:08,324 --> 00:29:09,542
You know what to do.

551
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:13,713
No!

552
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,168
You little shit!

553
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,270
No!

554
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,394
(girl screams)

555
00:29:31,064 --> 00:29:33,032
That was you?

556
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:34,817
That bully had it coming.

557
00:29:34,868 --> 00:29:37,853
I knew I didn't do it.

558
00:29:37,904 --> 00:29:40,289
Why did you help me?

559
00:29:40,356 --> 00:29:41,907
Who are you?

560
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:48,226
What are you?

561
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:51,584
At first, I saw you as
the daughter that I never had.

562
00:29:54,087 --> 00:29:57,539
<i>I wanted to protect my,</i>
<i>my little flower.</i>

563
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:03,345
<i>But you are no hothouse orchid.</i>

564
00:30:05,315 --> 00:30:08,601
<i>There's nothing fragile</i>
<i>about you, Fiona.</i>

565
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,406
<i>As you, as you grew,</i>
<i>I began to see</i>

566
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:17,243
<i>the-the fire in your belly</i>

567
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:20,830
<i>and the steel running down</i>
<i>your back.</i>

568
00:30:20,897 --> 00:30:23,949
<i>You were the most fearsome</i>
<i>thing that ever lived.</i>

569
00:30:27,621 --> 00:30:33,425
<i>And while others only saw</i>
<i>the ruthless manipulator,</i>

570
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,796
<i>I saw so, so much more.</i>

571
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:47,189
<i>And my feelings...</i>
<i>became complicated.</i>

572
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:51,694
<i>And I fell in love...</i>

573
00:30:55,732 --> 00:30:58,567
<i>But not like a father...</i>

574
00:30:58,618 --> 00:31:00,769
<i>like a man.</i>

575
00:31:14,301 --> 00:31:16,952
I don't believe in ghosts.

576
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:18,954
Nor did I feel like one.

577
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:20,639
I felt like I was locked

578
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:23,976
in an airless closet
for eternity.

579
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,595
And when you arrived,
you gave meaning

580
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:29,148
to my endless, tortured days.

581
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:31,267
All I want to do is
give you pleasure.

582
00:31:31,318 --> 00:31:34,687
You deserve it.
Baby, you've lived through so much.

583
00:31:39,242 --> 00:31:40,910
(both moan)

584
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:44,363
(grunts)

585
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:48,250
Jesus Christ...

586
00:31:49,452 --> 00:31:51,954
you call that a seduction, huh?

587
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:53,756
What an idiot,

588
00:31:53,823 --> 00:31:58,344
telling me my life story,
how you watched me grow old.

589
00:31:58,428 --> 00:32:01,830
What was that, a mercy lay?!

590
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:05,000
It was a, a culmination.

591
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,171
Zip me up.

592
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:19,514
No, you keep your distance,
lover boy.

593
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:22,735
Go haunt someone else's life!

594
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:33,128
(gasps)

595
00:32:37,384 --> 00:32:38,500
Hey, Spalding.

596
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:41,387
How are you feeling?

597
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:42,704
Fine.

598
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,759
I feel fine.

599
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:54,049
How am I...?

600
00:33:02,892 --> 00:33:04,777
Whose tongue is this?

601
00:33:04,861 --> 00:33:06,111
Yours.

602
00:33:08,898 --> 00:33:11,066
I found it the other day,

603
00:33:11,117 --> 00:33:13,002
hidden away.

604
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:15,838
<i>At first, I didn't realize</i>
<i>what it was.</i>

605
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:18,740
<i>I mean, a severed tongue,</i>
<i>stored away for 40 years?</i>

606
00:33:18,792 --> 00:33:20,092
<i>You'd think</i>
<i>it'd be shriveled up</i>

607
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:21,710
<i>like a slice of beef jerky</i>
<i>by now.</i>

608
00:33:21,761 --> 00:33:23,012
(gasps)

609
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,214
But it wasn't. It was wet,

610
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:27,082
alive...

611
00:33:27,133 --> 00:33:28,750
because someone enchanted it.

612
00:33:28,802 --> 00:33:31,920
Isn't that right?

613
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:35,391
Yes.

614
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:37,092
"M.S."

615
00:33:39,262 --> 00:33:40,529
Myrtle Snow.

616
00:33:40,596 --> 00:33:42,481
She wanted you
to tell the truth.

617
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:44,650
But that was the last thing
that you wanted to do.

618
00:33:44,734 --> 00:33:48,203
So you cut it out
of your own head.

619
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:50,873
Answer me!

620
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,742
Yes!

621
00:33:53,793 --> 00:33:56,662
Bet you didn't know
that she kept it.

622
00:33:56,746 --> 00:34:00,449
But Myrtle wasn't
witch enough to restore it.

623
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,052
But I'm not Myrtle.

624
00:34:06,556 --> 00:34:09,591
<i>Infernales, curare hominem.</i>

625
00:34:09,642 --> 00:34:11,643
<i>Restitue eum ad naturam.</i>

626
00:34:11,728 --> 00:34:15,097
<i>Infernales, curare hominem.</i>

627
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:18,350
<i>Restitue eum ad naturam.</i>

628
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,487
(chuckles)

629
00:34:41,674 --> 00:34:44,877
What do you want from me, hmm?

630
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:47,329
The only thing
that you can't refuse me.

631
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:50,349
The truth.

632
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,834
Did you kill
Madison Montgomery?

633
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:57,506
M-Madison Montgomery...

634
00:34:57,557 --> 00:34:58,891
is alive.

635
00:34:58,975 --> 00:35:01,009
That wasn't the question.
No!

636
00:35:01,061 --> 00:35:04,363
I didn't kill her.

637
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:05,564
But you know who did.

638
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:09,201
Yes!

639
00:35:09,285 --> 00:35:10,852
I do!

640
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:13,122
Say the name.

641
00:35:14,392 --> 00:35:17,692
Please don't make me!
Say the name.

642
00:35:17,744 --> 00:35:20,829
(groaning)

643
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,197
Say it.

644
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:25,000
(spitting sound)

645
00:35:25,051 --> 00:35:27,219
Fiona!

646
00:35:27,303 --> 00:35:30,422
Fiona Goode!

647
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:32,891
I say her name.

648
00:35:32,976 --> 00:35:35,561
I bless it!

649
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:38,397
As long as there is a tongue
in this head, I will say it!

650
00:35:38,481 --> 00:35:39,731
I will always say her name!

651
00:35:39,816 --> 00:35:41,550
Fiona Goode!

652
00:35:41,601 --> 00:35:44,603
Our Supreme!

653
00:35:44,687 --> 00:35:46,438
She's not your Supreme,
Spalding.

654
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:47,906
She's your employer.

655
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:50,409
You're not a part
of this coven.

656
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:55,080
My family has served
this coven...

657
00:35:55,165 --> 00:35:58,083
for ten generations.

658
00:35:58,168 --> 00:36:02,404
I have devoted my life to it.

659
00:36:02,455 --> 00:36:04,239
Not anymore.

660
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,407

661
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,009

662
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:08,961
You're done talking.

663
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:32,671
Care for a nibble?

664
00:36:32,738 --> 00:36:34,172
I'm not here for that.

665
00:36:35,422 --> 00:36:37,609
I need to ask you something.

666
00:36:40,813 --> 00:36:42,564
What's the worst thing
you ever did?

667
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,487
The past is best left buried.

668
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,523
I feel like

669
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:54,826
maybe we have a connection.

670
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:57,329
And my mama always said

671
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,547
that in order to
be a true friend,

672
00:36:59,632 --> 00:37:02,033
you have to see the ugly

673
00:37:02,084 --> 00:37:03,701
to appreciate the good.

674
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:06,004
You think we could be
true friends?

675
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:10,091
I perhaps had...

676
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:12,477
one slight regret.

677
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:20,852
LaLAURIE:
Sally?

678
00:37:20,903 --> 00:37:24,356
I've missed your presence
for the last fortnight.

679
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:28,159
Rumor has it that you gave
birth to a baby.

680
00:37:28,227 --> 00:37:29,577
Yes, ma'am, a healthy baby boy.

681
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:31,029
Oh, Ida says

682
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,747
he's beautiful
with a complexion

683
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:34,749
as light as cream.

684
00:37:34,834 --> 00:37:37,235
What's the boy's name?

685
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:40,538
Haven't settled on one yet, ma'am.
Hmm.

686
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:43,908
I've always been fond of
"Pierre" as a boy's name.

687
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,710
(chuckling):
Have you now?

688
00:37:45,761 --> 00:37:48,513
Kitchen's too hard
for a new mother.

689
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,582
Now that Borquita is serving
her punishment,

690
00:37:51,634 --> 00:37:53,802
I need a new handmaiden.

691
00:37:53,886 --> 00:37:55,720
Would you come
to my boudoir tonight?

692
00:37:55,771 --> 00:37:57,422
Help me
with my beauty treatments?

693
00:37:57,473 --> 00:37:58,589
Yes, ma'am.

694
00:37:58,641 --> 00:38:00,892
Thank you, ma'am.

695
00:38:05,764 --> 00:38:07,816
<i>Elixir de jeunesse.</i>

696
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,069
This little jar came
all the way from Paris.

697
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,937
Madame Lafayette swore

698
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:15,440
it took ten years off her face.

699
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:17,625
I could've saved a fortune
if I'd only seen

700
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,944
the bitch in broad daylight.

701
00:38:19,996 --> 00:38:22,280
They're all worthless.

702
00:38:22,331 --> 00:38:24,299
Every single one.

703
00:38:24,383 --> 00:38:26,134
Except this.

704
00:38:26,218 --> 00:38:29,471
My own concoction.

705
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:31,256
The formulation of which

706
00:38:31,307 --> 00:38:33,675
I will carry with me
to my grave.

707
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:36,061
Let's play a game.

708
00:38:36,128 --> 00:38:39,064
Can you guess
one of the secret ingredients?

709
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:41,182
It looks like blood, ma'am.

710
00:38:41,267 --> 00:38:42,984
Very good.

711
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:45,103
You're a smart girl.

712
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:48,323
But this batch is extra special.

713
00:38:48,407 --> 00:38:50,608
Can you guess why?

714
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,331
Came from a boy.

715
00:38:56,415 --> 00:38:59,000
Newly born.

716
00:38:59,085 --> 00:39:01,286
Youth begets youth.

717
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:06,958
I know who's been
between your legs, whore.

718
00:39:07,009 --> 00:39:10,261
You needn't bother
to give that baby a name.

719
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:20,972
You didn't.

720
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:23,441
Couldn't have a high yellow
bastard growing up

721
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:26,694
in my house,
laying claims to our fortune.

722
00:39:26,779 --> 00:39:28,679
<i>The poor girl, next morning</i>

723
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:32,150

725
00:39:35,154 --> 00:39:38,740

It was the right thing to do.

728
00:39:43,462 --> 00:39:44,796
You have no idea

729
00:39:44,863 --> 00:39:47,332
what doing the right
thing even means.

730

731
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:51,503
You must understand.

732
00:39:51,554 --> 00:39:54,038
It wasn't only a different time.

733
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,926
It was a different world.

734
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,811

00:39:59,878 --> 00:40:02,430
I'm grateful.

736
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,186
To have someone.

737
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:10,388
A true friend.

738
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,440

None of my business.

749
00:41:33,572 --> 00:41:35,713
You brought the dude
back from the dead.

It's gonna take more than just
that thing between your legs

to kill him.

Not even close.
