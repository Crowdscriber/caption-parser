1
00:00:00,903 --> 00:00:01,977
Previously on Hannibal...

2
00:00:02,012 --> 00:00:03,471
Layers and layers of lies

3
00:00:03,596 --> 00:00:06,549
betrayed by a sad glint
in a Childs eyes.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,212
How did you feel like
seeing Marissa shore,

5
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:11,231
- impaled in his antler room?
- Guilty.

6
00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:13,111
Because you couldn't save her?

7
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:15,173
Because I felt like I killed her.

8
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:16,558
Our friend will

9
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,365
seems haunted today.

10
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,706
We don't know what nightmares
lie coiled

11
00:00:20,831 --> 00:00:24,227
- beneath will's pillow.
- At night I leave the lights on

12
00:00:24,352 --> 00:00:25,308
in my little house.

13
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:29,536
And walk across the flat fields.
When I look back from a distance

14
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:31,564
the house is like a boat on the sea.

15
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,849
It's really the only time I feel safe.

16
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:37,005
- Children transport us to our childhoods.
- What do you see will?

17
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,208
Will may feel the tug of life, before
the FBI, before you.

18
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,699
He needs an anker Jack.

19
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:43,046
Where you going?

20
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:45,350
I wanna go home.

21
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:54,363
You lost?

22
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:56,698
Uh, what?

23
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:59,167
What's your name?

24
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:02,871
Will Graham.

25
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,174
Do you know where
you are, Mr. Graham?

26
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:09,210
No.

27
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:11,746
Where do you live?

28
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:15,650
Wolf trap, Virginia.

29
00:02:15,717 --> 00:02:19,553
We're in wolf trap, so that's
good. You're close to home.

30
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,856
Is that yours?

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,326
Aw, hi, Winston.

32
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:29,328
Hey...

33
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,698
uh, can I sit down?
My feet are sore.

34
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:35,135
Why don't we take you home?

35
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:40,274
Are you on any drugs?
Medication?

36
00:02:40,342 --> 00:02:42,241
Prescription or otherwise? No.

37
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:43,776
You been drinkin'?

38
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:46,779
No. Uh, yes. Not excessively.

39
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:49,248
I had two fingers of whiskey
before I went to bed.

40
00:02:49,316 --> 00:02:53,519
You have a history
of sleepwalking, Mr. Graham?

41
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:57,790
I'm not even sure
if I'm awake now.

42
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:13,271
Although I may be, is it safe

43
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:17,008
to assume you're not sleepwalking now?
I'm sorry it's so early.

44
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:20,411
Never apologize
for coming to me.

45
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,714
Office hours are for patients. My
kitchen is always open to friends.

46
00:03:27,986 --> 00:03:31,287
Onset of sleepwalking
in adulthood

47
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:34,624
is less common than in children.
Could it be a seizure?

48
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:39,429
I'd argue good old-fashioned
post-traumatic stress.

49
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:41,797
Jack Crawford has gotten
your hands very dirty.

50
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:45,568
- I wasn't forced back into the field.
- I wouldn't say "forced".

51
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:48,270
"Manipulated" would be
the word I'd choose.

52
00:03:48,338 --> 00:03:50,672
I can handle it.

53
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,242
Somewhere between
denying horrible events

54
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:55,911
and calling them out lies the
truth of psychological trauma.

55
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:58,313
So I can't handle it.

56
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:00,382
Your experience may have
overwhelmed ordinary functions

57
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,417
that give you
a sense of control.

58
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:05,420
If my body is walking around
without my permission,

59
00:04:05,487 --> 00:04:07,888
you'd say that's
a loss of control?

60
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:11,825
Wouldn't you?

61
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,534
Sleepwalkers demonstrate
a difficulty

62
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:23,903
handling aggression.
Are you experiencing

63
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:27,240
difficulty with
aggressive feelings?

64
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,477
You said Jack sees me
as fine China

65
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:34,246
used for special guests.

66
00:04:34,314 --> 00:04:37,216
I'm beginning to feel
more like an old mug.

67
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:40,704
You entered into a
devil's bargain

68
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:42,188
with Jack Crawford.
It takes a toll.

69
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:45,791
Jack isn't the devil.

70
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,843
When it comes to how
far he's willing

71
00:04:47,844 --> 00:04:49,828
to push you to get
what he wants,

72
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,897
he's certainly no Saint.

73
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:54,553
Sync and correction by GeirDM
www.addic7ed.com

74
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:03,819
room was registered to a John
Smith. Heh, big surprise there.

75
00:06:03,887 --> 00:06:06,121
An appalling failure
of imagination.

76
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:09,124
They paid cash.
There are no security cameras

77
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,125
on the premises...
another big surprise.

78
00:06:11,193 --> 00:06:14,328
- John Smith one of the victims?
- Mr. and Mrs. Anderson,

79
00:06:14,396 --> 00:06:17,031
according to the register.
They were mutilated and displayed.

80
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:19,099
I thought it might be
the chesapeake ripper,

81
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,002
but there were no
surgical trophies taken.

82
00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:24,237
I'm gonna need you to prepare
yourself on this one. I'm prepared.

83
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:26,239
Prepare yourself some more.
It's soup in there.

84
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:28,976
- Soup isn't good for the soul.
- Not this kind.

85
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:31,778
Alright, look, there are no
jurisdictional rivalries here.

86
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:35,080
The local police begged us
to take this. Where's your head?

87
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:38,751
It's on my pillow.
I didn't sleep.

88
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,888
Got just the thing
to wake you up.

89
00:07:02,742 --> 00:07:05,309
Ok, I'm awake.

90
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:11,015
Hooks were bored
into the ceiling.

91
00:07:11,116 --> 00:07:12,850
Fishing line was used

92
00:07:12,918 --> 00:07:16,521
to hold up the bodies
and... the wings.

93
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:19,190
- At least we know he's a fisherman.
- And/or a viking.

94
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:21,559
Vikings do this?

95
00:07:21,626 --> 00:07:24,894
Vikings used to execute christians
by breaking their ribs,

96
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:27,030
bending them back, and
draping the lungs over them

97
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:29,099
to resemble wings.
They used to call it

98
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:33,336
a "blood eagle." Pagans
mocking the Godfearing.

99
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:37,340
- Then who's mocking who?
- No, he isn't mocking them.

100
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:40,242
He's transforming them.
I don't know if it was

101
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,478
a good night's sleep,
but he slept here.

102
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,880
Hair on the pillow and
the sheets are still damp.

103
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:47,083
He's a sweater.

104
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,351
Madness slept here last night.

105
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:53,522
He threw up on the nightstand.

106
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,424
Couldn't stomach what he did.

107
00:07:56,492 --> 00:07:58,359
Flop sweat and
nervous indigestion.

108
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:00,528
Not nervous.

109
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,932
Righteous.

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,803
Thinks he's...
Elevating them somehow.

111
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:16,276
I need a plastic sheet
for the bed.

112
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,413
This is not who you are.

113
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:04,288
This is my gift to you.

114
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:15,399
I allow you to become angels.

115
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:20,337
And now,

116
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:23,106
I lay me down to sleep.

117
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:53,168
<i>A masterpiece
foie gras au torchon</i>

118
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:55,770
with a late harvest

119
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:57,706
of vidal sauce...

120
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,477
With dried and fresh figs.

121
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,878
Wonderful.

122
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:06,880
Mrs. Crawford, your husband

123
00:10:06,948 --> 00:10:09,917
introduced you as Bella. Are you
an Isabelle or an Annabelle?

124
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,019
I'm a Phyllis.

125
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,789
Jack only calls me Phyllis
when we disagree.

126
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:20,560
So, named Bella
for your beauty.

127
00:10:20,628 --> 00:10:23,630
We were both stationed in Italy.
I was army, she was NATO staff.

128
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:26,033
All of the Italian men
kept calling her

129
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:28,135
"Bella, Bella, Bella."

130
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:30,571
Well, I wanted her
to be my Bella.

131
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:37,410
Mm. Cold foie gras

132
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:40,380
- with warm figs.
- Yes.

133
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:42,181
Very nice.

134
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,585
Would I be a horrible guest
if I skipped this course?

135
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,621
- Too rich?
- Too cruel.

136
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,155
Phyllis.

137
00:10:49,223 --> 00:10:51,357
- Jack.
- First and worst sign

138
00:10:51,424 --> 00:10:54,360
Cruelty to animals.

139
00:10:54,427 --> 00:10:57,829
That doesn't apply
in the kitchen.

140
00:10:57,897 --> 00:10:59,665
I have no taste
for animal cruelty,

141
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,501
which is why I employ
an ethical butcher.

142
00:11:02,569 --> 00:11:06,138
An ethical butcher? Be kind
to animals and then eat them?

143
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:09,140
I'm afraid I insist on it.

144
00:11:09,207 --> 00:11:12,977
No need for unnecessary
suffering.

145
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:22,953
Human emotions are a gift
from our animal ancestors.

146
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,954
Cruelty is a gift

147
00:11:25,022 --> 00:11:27,457
humanity has given itself.

148
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:30,694
The gift that keeps on giving.

149
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:41,170
Your perfume is exquisite.

150
00:11:41,237 --> 00:11:44,640
Similar to the aroma on the earth
just after lightning strikes.

151
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:47,777
Is it jar?

152
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:50,346
That is some nose
you have there, doctor.

153
00:11:50,414 --> 00:11:52,881
He really is quite
charming, isn't he?

154
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:55,050
I first noticed
my keen sense of smell

155
00:11:55,118 --> 00:11:57,285
when I was a young man.

156
00:11:57,353 --> 00:12:00,087
I was aware one of my teachers
had stomach cancer

157
00:12:00,155 --> 00:12:03,191
- even before he was.
- Hm.

158
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:05,427
Wow, that must have been
some parlor trick.

159
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:09,130
For our next course,

160
00:12:09,198 --> 00:12:12,533
roasted pork shank.
And I assure you, Bella,

161
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,102
it was an especially
supercilious pig.

162
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:28,013
"Death makes angels
of us all and gives us wings

163
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,216
where we had shoulders
smooth as raven's claws."

164
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,419
- Robert Frost.
- Jim Morrison.

165
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:37,223
Even a drunk with
a flair for the dramatic

166
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,727
can convince himself he's God.
Or the lizard king.

167
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:44,295
God makes angels. Jesus was
fond of fishermen.

168
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,082
Are we talking hardcore
Judeo-Christian

169
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:47,799
upsetting, or just
upsetting in general?

170
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,901
This is a very
specific upsetting.

171
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,903
Increased serotonin
in the wounds

172
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,740
is much higher than
the free histamines, so, uh,

173
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,243
she lived for about 15 minutes
after she was skinned.

174
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,611
Powder residue on
the neck of the soda bottle

175
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,780
shows Vecuronium...

176
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,750
scotch and soda
and a paralytic agent.

177
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,552
Kneeling in supplication
at the feet of g-dash-d.

178
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,389
Supplication is the most
common form of prayer.

179
00:13:11,456 --> 00:13:14,425
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

180
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:17,026
They weren't praying to him.

181
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:19,829
They were praying for him.

182
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:25,968
He's afraid.

183
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:28,438
What is somebody who
could do something like this

184
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,840
afraid of?

185
00:13:31,836 --> 00:13:32,997
- What's in his vomit?
- Uh, Dexamethasone...

186
00:13:33,122 --> 00:13:35,431
Uh, Dexamethasone...

187
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,141
That's used for patients
with tumors.

188
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:40,482
Kepra... He's epileptic.
Radiation?

189
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,351
- Gamma four.
- Steroids for the inflammation,

190
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,588
anticonvulsants for the seizures,
radiation for the chemotherapy.

191
00:13:46,656 --> 00:13:48,856
Our guy has a brain tumor.

192
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,662
He's afraid of dying
in his sleep.

193
00:13:56,765 --> 00:14:00,735
He's making angels
to watch over him.

194
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:09,413
Mrs. Crawford.

195
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,782
Please come in.

196
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:17,221
How often do you see him?

197
00:14:17,288 --> 00:14:19,688
Twice a week at first.

198
00:14:19,756 --> 00:14:21,690
Now usually just once.

199
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:23,993
You're satisfied, then?

200
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:26,029
Enough to keep seeing him.

201
00:14:26,096 --> 00:14:28,631
Your intention is
not to tell Jack.

202
00:14:28,698 --> 00:14:33,336
I don't see what good
it would do.

203
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:36,771
Jack sees the world
at its worst.

204
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,174
Don't need him
seeing me at mine.

205
00:14:39,242 --> 00:14:41,476
He already has
too much to worry about.

206
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:44,379
He has room for one more worry.

207
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:49,284
I feel like
you're protecting him.

208
00:14:49,352 --> 00:14:53,054
I am. I've had dinner

209
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:55,523
at your home.

210
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,292
You have a professional
relationship with my husband.

211
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,429
There's no conflict of interest,
me being here?

212
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:03,464
It's unorthodox,

213
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:06,367
but not unheard of.

214
00:15:06,435 --> 00:15:09,035
Given the nature of your problem,
seeing someone who knows Jack

215
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:11,171
removes some of the guesswork.

216
00:15:14,975 --> 00:15:18,778
This all started
as some misguided stab

217
00:15:18,845 --> 00:15:21,481
at maintaining my dignity.

218
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:24,316
Nothing undignified about this.

219
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:26,552
Not yet.

220
00:15:26,619 --> 00:15:29,188
But I have indignity

221
00:15:29,255 --> 00:15:31,323
to look forward to, don't I?

222
00:15:31,391 --> 00:15:34,560
The only indignity
I see is resentment.

223
00:15:36,662 --> 00:15:39,464
Why do you resent your husband?

224
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:45,503
I resent that Jack...

225
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,005
Has too much to worry about

226
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,674
to worry about me.

227
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,743
But that's your choice.

228
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:54,845
Not his.

229
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:58,548
Then maybe you should see us
both for couples counseling.

230
00:15:58,616 --> 00:16:02,119
I would recommend another
psychiatrist for couples.

231
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:06,423
I wouldn't want you to have
the home-couch advantage.

232
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:08,758
It's hard enough

233
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:11,527
dealing with how I feel
about all of this.

234
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,730
Don't need to deal with
how Jack feels about it.

235
00:16:20,403 --> 00:16:24,106
There is no one and only
spiritual center of the brain.

236
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:27,042
Any idea of God comes from many
different areas of the mind

237
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,277
working together in unison.

238
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:31,346
Maybe I was wrong.

239
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:34,549
How do you profile
someone who has

240
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:37,585
an anomaly in their head
changing the way they think?

241
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:41,156
A tumor can definitely
affect brain function,

242
00:16:41,223 --> 00:16:44,358
even cause vivid hallucinations.
However, what appears

243
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:47,861
to be driving your angel maker
to create heaven on earth

244
00:16:47,928 --> 00:16:51,665
is a simple issue of mortality.
Can't beat God, become him?

245
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:55,502
You said he was afraid.

246
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,805
He feels abandoned.

247
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,342
Ever feel abandoned, will?

248
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,745
Abandonment requires
expectation.

249
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:09,982
What were your expectations

250
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,452
of Jack Crawford and the FBI?

251
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,453
Jack hasn't abandoned me.

252
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:18,223
Not in any discernible way.

253
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:21,693
Perhaps in the way gods
abandon their creations.

254
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:24,531
You say he hasn't abandoned you,
but at the same time you

255
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:27,277
find yourself wandering around
Wolftrap in the middle of the night.

256
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,335
Well...
This should be interesting.

257
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:34,505
Please, doctor, proceed.

258
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:38,576
Jack gave you his word
he would protect your headspace,

259
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:41,412
yet he leaves you
to your mental devices.

260
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:45,716
Are you trying to alienate me
from Jack Crawford?

261
00:17:45,783 --> 00:17:50,119
I'm trying to help you
understand this angel maker

262
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:52,121
you seek.
Well, help me understand

263
00:17:52,189 --> 00:17:54,857
how to catch him.
If he were a classic paranoid

264
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:58,595
schizophrenic, you might be able
to influence him

265
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,264
to become visible. What, scare
him out into the daylight?

266
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:04,299
Might even get him
to hurt himself,

267
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:06,435
if he hasn't already.
If he were selfdestructive,

268
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,670
he-he-he wouldn't be so careful.

269
00:18:08,738 --> 00:18:12,441
Unless he's careful
about being self-destructive,

270
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:17,011
making angels to pray over him
when he sleeps.

271
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:24,084
Who prays over us when we sleep?

272
00:18:29,157 --> 00:18:32,460
So, do you wait until you think I'm
asleep before you come to bed?

273
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,462
It's not intentional.

274
00:18:34,529 --> 00:18:36,229
I'm working late.

275
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:40,166
Nothing personal.

276
00:18:40,234 --> 00:18:42,419
So can we have a
conversation, or do you

277
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,604
want to pretend that
everything's alright?

278
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:48,074
Everything is alright.

279
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:51,210
So no conversation.

280
00:18:53,246 --> 00:18:55,714
I'm a bit overwhelmed
at the moment.

281
00:18:55,782 --> 00:18:59,418
- With?
- With things at work...

282
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:01,720
Etcetera.

283
00:19:01,788 --> 00:19:05,591
I've got some things
I have to sort through.

284
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:08,760
It's, uh, outside
your jurisdiction, Jack.

285
00:19:08,827 --> 00:19:11,896
You know something...

286
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:14,699
I'm very good
at sorting things out,

287
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,901
and at the very least
I can underwhelm you

288
00:19:16,968 --> 00:19:19,254
while you're being overwhelmed.
You've

289
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:21,539
never been able
to underwhelm me.

290
00:19:21,607 --> 00:19:24,225
Is there anything I can
offer you romantically

291
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:26,843
or physically or
spiritually that'll help?

292
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:28,978
Nope.

293
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:33,817
So as your husband,
what I can do for you is, um,

294
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:37,086
leave you alone and not ask you
any questions.

295
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,258
You can ask me anything
you want to.

296
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:47,931
I won't insult you by asking
if there's someone else.

297
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:52,601
Thank you.

298
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:55,388
You'll sort out
whatever it is you have

299
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:58,106
to sort out, we'll get
back to being us.

300
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:02,945
I love you, Bella.

301
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:10,686
I love you too.

302
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,675
Why angels?

303
00:20:54,743 --> 00:20:57,912
Well, it isn't biblical.
His angels have wings.

304
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:02,582
Um, angels in sculptures and paintings
can fly, but not in scripture.

305
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,918
He's drawing
from secular sources?

306
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:08,823
His mind has turned against him
and there's no one there to help.

307
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:10,970
Uh, Jack... look at this.

308
00:21:11,763 --> 00:21:13,763
Are those... What are those?

309
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,900
Somebody got an orchiectomy
real cheap.

310
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:21,438
- Doesn't look like the victim.
- So they're the angel maker's?

311
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:24,040
- He castrated himself?
- So he isn't just

312
00:21:24,108 --> 00:21:26,242
making angels; He's getting
ready to become one.

313
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,678
Angels don't have genitalia.

314
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:34,583
So he was afraid of dying. Now he's,
what, getting used to the idea?

315
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,252
He's accepting it
or he's bargaining.

316
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,456
- Heh, bargaining chips!
- So, does this mean that

317
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:42,391
he's done making angels,
or is he just getting started?

318
00:21:42,459 --> 00:21:44,659
- I don't know.
- Well, he's not just

319
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:46,961
killing them when he's sleepy.
I mean, how is he choosing them?

320
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:48,963
- I don't know. Ask him.
- I'm asking you.

321
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,499
You're the head of the
behavioral science unit, Jack.

322
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:55,669
Why don't you come up with your own
answers if you don't like mine?

323
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,907
I did not hear that!

324
00:21:59,975 --> 00:22:03,110
Did I?

325
00:22:03,177 --> 00:22:04,711
Um...

326
00:22:07,681 --> 00:22:10,283
No, you didn't.

327
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:11,884
I'm sorry.

328
00:22:47,653 --> 00:22:50,621
I've never heard anybody talk to
Jack the way you talked to Jack.

329
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:53,190
- I was out of line.
- You were out of your mind.

330
00:22:53,258 --> 00:22:56,560
My ears rang like the first time
I heard my mom use the f-word.

331
00:22:56,628 --> 00:23:00,063
You ok?

332
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:03,400
I know it's a stupid question
considering that none of us

333
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:07,836
could possibly be ok doing what
we do, but... are you ok?

334
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:10,939
Do I seem different?

335
00:23:11,007 --> 00:23:13,309
You're a little different,

336
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,611
but you've always been
a little different.

337
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,613
Brilliant strategy...

338
00:23:17,681 --> 00:23:19,715
that way no one ever knows
if something's up with you.

339
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:21,816
How would I know if something
was up with you?

340
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,985
You wouldn't.

341
00:23:24,053 --> 00:23:28,890
But I would tell you if you
asked me. Return the favor?

342
00:23:28,957 --> 00:23:32,827
Meet Roger and Marilyn Brunner.

343
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:35,830
You might recognize them
from such lists as most wanted.

344
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,499
He likes to rape and murder,
she likes to watch.

345
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,901
We got a DNA match.
They falsified

346
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:43,470
the motel registry
and were driving a stolen car,

347
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:45,573
so it took a second
to identify them.

348
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,676
I wonder how long it took
angel maker to identify them.

349
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:52,489
He didn't choose them randomly.
He knows something about them.

350
00:23:52,614 --> 00:23:56,115
The murdered security guard
wasn't actually a security guard.

351
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,488
He was a convicted felon.

352
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,152
Could angel maker be
a vigilante?

353
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,956
Well, vigilantes are
pragmatic, they're purposeful;

354
00:24:05,025 --> 00:24:08,494
They don't lay down and sleep
under their crimes.

355
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:14,699
In his mind, he was doing God's work.
That spells vigilante.

356
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:18,202
Well, playing at God has
other advantages. One of them...

357
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,106
Is always being alone. So he
makes angels out of demons.

358
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:24,009
How does he know
they're demons?

359
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,677
He doesn't have to know.

360
00:24:26,745 --> 00:24:29,112
All he has to do is believe.

361
00:24:34,719 --> 00:24:37,588
Has Jack begun to suspect?

362
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:39,924
He's a behavioral specialist.
He must know

363
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:41,926
you are keeping something
from him.

364
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:46,663
Oh, he knows. He asked me
if I was having an affair...

365
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:49,966
by reassuring me
that he didn't have to ask.

366
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:52,602
I doubt he believes
you're unfaithful.

367
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,537
And why do you doubt that?

368
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:57,473
It's clear you love
your husband.

369
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:01,843
Women who love their husbands still
find reasons to cheat on them.

370
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:05,647
Not you.

371
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:08,951
Still, you seem more betrayed
by Jack than by your own body.

372
00:25:10,887 --> 00:25:14,022
I don't feel betrayed by Jack.

373
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:17,725
And there's no point in being
mad at cancer for being cancer.

374
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:19,193
Sure there is.

375
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,063
Cancer isn't cruel.

376
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,166
Tiny cell wanders off
from my liver, gets lost,

377
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:28,168
finds its way into my lung,

378
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:31,170
where it's just trying
to do its job and...

379
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,372
Grow a liver.

380
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,877
What it grows and where it's
growing it will likely kill you.

381
00:25:37,945 --> 00:25:40,346
Not likely.

382
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,849
It will kill me,

383
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:48,153
and no amount of blueberries or
antioxidants can change that now.

384
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:51,556
But you hold Jack accountable for
his inability to cure cancer.

385
00:25:53,994 --> 00:25:56,361
Should I have said
his inability to save you?

386
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:02,334
Would that be more accurate?
I am slowly shrinking,

387
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:06,237
while this tiny thing grows
larger every day.

388
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,775
And yet I feel fine.

389
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:13,577
You will feel fine...

390
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:16,080
up until the precise moment
you don't.

391
00:26:16,148 --> 00:26:21,752
It's a... really very
dull story, though, isn't it?

392
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:27,090
The ending is always the same,
and that same is that it ends.

393
00:26:27,158 --> 00:26:31,461
So, you withdraw

394
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:34,631
from your relationship
with your husband,

395
00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:37,199
the man who strolled along
the quays of Livorno, Italy,

396
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:39,902
and called you Bella.

397
00:27:57,454 --> 00:28:00,057
It's difficult to lie still
and fear going to sleep.

398
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:03,059
What is there to think about?

399
00:28:03,126 --> 00:28:05,360
You listen to your breathing
in the dark

400
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:07,797
and the tiny clicks
of your blinking eyes.

401
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:10,666
I dream more now
than I used to.

402
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:12,534
Well, your dreams were
the one place you could be

403
00:28:12,602 --> 00:28:16,072
physically safe, relinquishing
control. Not anymore.

404
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:18,573
Yeah, I thought about zipping
myself up into a sleeping bag

405
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,875
before I go to sleep,
but it, heh,

406
00:28:20,943 --> 00:28:23,578
sounds like a poor man's
straightjacket.

407
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:29,117
Have you determined how this angel
maker is choosing his victims?

408
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:33,287
Well, he doesn't see people
how everyone else sees them.

409
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:36,523
He can tell if you're naughty
or nice,

410
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,592
or he thinks he can.

411
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:43,831
So God has given this person
insight into the souls of men.

412
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:46,533
God didn't give him insight;
God gave him a tumor.

413
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:52,571
He's just a man whose brain is
playing tricks on him.

414
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:56,475
You are not unlike this killer.

415
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:58,778
My brain is playing tricks
on me?

416
00:28:58,846 --> 00:29:02,448
You want to feel such sweet
and easy peace.

417
00:29:02,515 --> 00:29:04,450
The angel maker wants
that same peace.

418
00:29:04,517 --> 00:29:08,019
He hopes to feel his way
cautiously inside and then find

419
00:29:08,087 --> 00:29:10,321
it's endless, all around him.

420
00:29:10,389 --> 00:29:12,724
He's gonna be disappointed.

421
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,860
You accept the impossibility
of such a feeling,

422
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:17,162
whereas the angel maker is
still chasing it.

423
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,999
If he got close to it,
that's why he will

424
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:23,419
look for it again. I've
tried to reconstruct

425
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,770
his thinking, find his patterns.

426
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:31,041
Instead you find yourself in a
behavior pattern you can't break.

427
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:33,543
You realize you have a choice.

428
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:35,612
What is it?

429
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,416
Angel maker will be destroyed by
what's happening inside his head;

430
00:29:40,484 --> 00:29:42,518
You don't have to be.

431
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:53,229
Did you just smell me?

432
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:56,265
Difficult to avoid.

433
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,901
I really must introduce you
to a finer aftershave.

434
00:29:58,968 --> 00:30:01,469
That smells like something
with a ship on the bottle.

435
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:03,705
Well, I keep getting it
for Christmas.

436
00:30:05,675 --> 00:30:08,277
Have your headaches been
any worse lately? More frequent?

437
00:30:08,344 --> 00:30:09,611
Yes, actually.

438
00:30:12,181 --> 00:30:14,182
I'd change the aftershave.

439
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:22,690
Elliot Budish: 35-year-old
truck driver.

440
00:30:22,757 --> 00:30:24,375
He's got a fishing license too.
Uh, match

441
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:25,992
came from the national
cancer database.

442
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,062
Married, two kids... they haven't
seen him in four months.

443
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,198
He was diagnosed
five months ago.

444
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:33,333
Meet the angel maker.

445
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,905
Have you heard from him
since he left?

446
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:40,907
I left him.

447
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:42,908
And, uh, no, no,

448
00:30:42,976 --> 00:30:44,910
I haven't.

449
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:47,446
Why did you leave?

450
00:30:49,449 --> 00:30:51,383
Because of his cancer.

451
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:54,286
It makes me sound
like a horrible wife.

452
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:56,989
I'm sure you had your reasons.

453
00:30:57,057 --> 00:31:02,227
I took a leave from work
to, uh, to be with him.

454
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,428
I wanted to be there for him.

455
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:07,832
But what he wanted was
to be alone.

456
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,501
He just kept pulling away

457
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:13,537
and pulling away.

458
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:15,774
He made it clear
he didn't want me there.

459
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:19,811
And then it wasn't clear.

460
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:24,816
And then it didn't matter why
he was acting the way he was.

461
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,021
It was weird

462
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,658
for the kids. I mean,

463
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,160
what kind of mother exposes
her children to someone

464
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,263
who is losing their mind?

465
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,370
Was he ever violent,
Mrs. Budish?

466
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:52,575
He was angry.

467
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,377
But he never

468
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:58,143
hit me or the boys.
It was hardest on them.

469
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:02,862
To see him slip away.
He lost himself.

470
00:32:03,452 --> 00:32:04,945
And they lost a father.

471
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:09,491
I thought that
as he got weaker,

472
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:13,796
as the cancer got worse,
that it would be less confusing

473
00:32:13,863 --> 00:32:17,566
for them.
They could just see him

474
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:20,468
as a sick man

475
00:32:20,536 --> 00:32:23,738
instead of someone
who was so terrified.

476
00:32:23,806 --> 00:32:28,576
And, uh, did your husband's
faith falter

477
00:32:28,644 --> 00:32:30,645
after he was told
about the cancer?

478
00:32:30,712 --> 00:32:35,482
Elliot wasn't ever religious.

479
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,885
Is he doing something religious?
He may believe he is.

480
00:32:38,953 --> 00:32:42,155
Your husband is dying,

481
00:32:42,222 --> 00:32:46,025
Mrs. Budish, and soon.

482
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:49,062
We'd just like

483
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:53,065
to... we'd like to find him before
he hurts himself or anyone else.

484
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:56,869
He... had a near-death
experience

485
00:32:59,773 --> 00:33:02,675
he suffocated in a fire
when he was a little boy.

486
00:33:04,945 --> 00:33:07,846
Fireman said he must've had
a guardian angel.

487
00:33:07,913 --> 00:33:09,814
Where did this happen?

488
00:33:09,882 --> 00:33:13,184
Um... a farm...

489
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:15,620
Where he grew up.

490
00:34:07,036 --> 00:34:10,338
- This'll be the last one.
- It's Budish?

491
00:34:10,406 --> 00:34:13,007
He made himself into an angel.

492
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,116
It wasn't God, it wasn't man.
It was his choice to die.

493
00:34:23,184 --> 00:34:25,953
- His choice?
- As much as he can make it.

494
00:34:35,529 --> 00:34:38,431
I don't know how much longer I can
be all that useful to you, Jack.

495
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:41,434
Really? You caught three.
The last three we had,

496
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:43,435
you caught.
You caught three of them.

497
00:34:43,502 --> 00:34:47,873
No, I didn't catch this one.
Elliot Budish... surrendered.

498
00:34:47,941 --> 00:34:51,043
You know, I'm used to my wife
not talking to me.

499
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:53,411
I don't have to get used to you
not talking to me too.

500
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:57,115
It's getting harder and harder
to make myself look.

501
00:34:57,183 --> 00:34:59,450
Well, nobody's asking you
to look alone.

502
00:34:59,517 --> 00:35:01,485
But I am looking alone.

503
00:35:01,553 --> 00:35:03,487
And you know what
looking at this does.

504
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:05,856
I know what happens
if you don't look,

505
00:35:05,924 --> 00:35:08,726
and so do you. I can
make myself look,

506
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:11,528
but the thinking
is shutting down.

507
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:13,698
- What is it about this one?
- It isn't this one.

508
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:15,316
It's all of them. It's
the next one, it's

509
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:16,866
the one that I know
is coming after that.

510
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:18,969
You wanna go back
to your lecture hall?

511
00:35:19,036 --> 00:35:22,105
Read about this stuff on tattlecrime.Com?
No, I don't.

512
00:35:22,172 --> 00:35:25,174
But that may be what I have
to do. This is bad for me.

513
00:35:25,242 --> 00:35:27,210
I'm not your father, will.

514
00:35:27,277 --> 00:35:30,246
I'm not gonna tell you
what you ought to do.

515
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:33,516
Seems like that's exactly
what you're gonna do.

516
00:35:35,752 --> 00:35:38,187
You go back to your classroom.

517
00:35:38,255 --> 00:35:40,689
When there's killing going on
that you could've prevented,

518
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:43,025
it will sour your classroom
forever.

519
00:35:43,093 --> 00:35:46,996
Maybe. And then maybe
I'll find a job

520
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:49,531
as a diesel mechanic
in a boatyard.

521
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,168
You wanna quit?

522
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,802
Quit.

523
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:23,957
I see what you are.

524
00:36:24,025 --> 00:36:26,593
What do you see?

525
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,962
Inside.

526
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,464
I can bring it out of you.

527
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,533
Not all the way out.

528
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:41,406
I can give you... The majesty

529
00:36:41,474 --> 00:36:44,409
of true becoming.

530
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,797
Hello, doctor.

531
00:37:06,865 --> 00:37:09,032
My wife and I need to talk.

532
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:12,736
May we use your waiting room? You
can have the office. Please.

533
00:37:12,804 --> 00:37:14,537
Thank you.

534
00:37:16,808 --> 00:37:18,776
Just popping in

535
00:37:18,843 --> 00:37:22,945
on official business,
or did you follow me?

536
00:37:23,013 --> 00:37:25,414
I called your office.
They said you were

537
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:29,118
at an appointment.
I figured you'd be here.

538
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:33,622
You know.

539
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:37,326
I knew you'd find out.

540
00:37:37,394 --> 00:37:40,628
When did you find out?

541
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:42,630
Twelve weeks ago.

542
00:37:42,698 --> 00:37:44,599
Twelve weeks ago?

543
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,503
Lung cancer.

544
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:55,475
You don't smoke.

545
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:57,744
The irony.

546
00:37:59,815 --> 00:38:01,481
Is it treatable?

547
00:38:03,484 --> 00:38:05,686
It's stage four.

548
00:38:07,689 --> 00:38:10,857
And we know there's
no stage five, don't we?

549
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:15,295
When were you gonna tell me?

550
00:38:18,432 --> 00:38:20,567
Far enough into the
future that I'm really

551
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:22,702
not prepared to have
this conversation

552
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,737
- right now.
- Neither am I,

553
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:27,272
but we're having it.
We're having it right now.

554
00:38:48,227 --> 00:38:50,594
Were you just going to wait

555
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,097
until you were in the middle
of chemotherapy?

556
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:57,168
When you couldn't hide it
anymore?

557
00:38:57,236 --> 00:38:59,369
I don't think I want
to do chemotherapy.

558
00:38:59,436 --> 00:39:00,871
Well, do I have any say

559
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,139
- in this?
- No.

560
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,242
No, you don't.

561
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,481
Do you want to be alone?

562
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:16,385
I don't want you
to answer that.

563
00:39:16,452 --> 00:39:18,487
Just think about your answer.

564
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:23,293
I want you to know
that I don't want

565
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,261
you to be alone, not
now and not ever.

566
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:28,530
We'll beat this together?

567
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:32,100
No, it's your fight, baby,
but I'm in your corner.

568
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,935
I'm not going anywhere.

569
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,307
I appreciate that, Jack.

570
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,943
I do.

571
00:39:43,946 --> 00:39:46,180
But I'm not comforted by it.

572
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,452
I know that's what you need
and, and...

573
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,623
you need to comfort me.

574
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,961
But I can't give you
what you need.

575
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:03,195
Don't worry about what I need.

576
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:10,069
Why wouldn't you tell me?

577
00:40:13,473 --> 00:40:17,576
I thought if I kept it to myself,
our lives wouldn't change.

578
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:26,751
I didn't count on changing
as much as I did.

579
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,227
What do you want, will?

580
00:41:28,443 --> 00:41:31,578
I'm gonna sit here
until you're ready to talk.

581
00:41:33,548 --> 00:41:36,875
You don't have to say a word
until you're ready, but...

582
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:40,009
I'm not going anywhere
until you do.
