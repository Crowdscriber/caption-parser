1
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:05,733
She has no identification,
no wallet, keys,

2
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:07,683
and she wouldn't talk to the cops.

3
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:09,854
So they dropped her on our doorstep?

4
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:12,140
When I was on the force,
we used to do that all the time.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,933
Involuntary psychiatric hold.
(patients screaming)

6
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,603
You know, we cut out
a lot of paperwork.

7
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:22,873
Wait here.

8
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:24,074
You got it.

9
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:29,212
What's your name?

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,184
I hear you caused
quite a disturbance tonight.

11
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:36,689
Some anti-Semitic remark
set you off.

12
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:38,623
They made a joke.

13
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:40,958
The businessmen at the bar.

14
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:43,860
They said,
"Don't let them Jew you down."

15
00:00:43,928 --> 00:00:45,418
That's how it always starts, you know?

16
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:47,360
With jokes.

17
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,328
There's blood on your coat there.

18
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:50,763
Is it yours? It's theirs.

19
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:52,399
I broke a beer bottle.
I stabbed them.

20
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,400
They will live, but...

21
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:56,470
they will never forget.

22
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:58,272
I'm not immune

23
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,307
to the atrocities
your people suffered.

24
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,311
Did you lose someone in the war?

25
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,150
(whistling)

26
00:01:13,957 --> 00:01:15,826
We'll start treatment
first thing in the morning.

27
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,852
Lock her up.

28
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,731
(whistling continues)

29
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:37,822
Am I going to die?

30
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:40,188
Not exactly.

31
00:01:40,256 --> 00:01:41,923
As a matter of fact,

32
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:44,692
after this, you'll
probably live forever.

33
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:50,327
(screaming)

34
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,118
I could sure use
a cigarette about now.

35
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:18,062
Arden?

36
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:20,625
Where is it?

37
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:22,928
That son of a bitch.

38
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,763
ARDEN: <i>No fresh incisions</i>

39
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,699
to indicate surgical implantation.

40
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,868
What'd it do, crawl back inside you?

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,687
Through which orifice?

42
00:03:35,755 --> 00:03:37,789
What are you talking about?

43
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:40,625
Yeah, he smacked me around,

44
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:41,993
shot me with X-rays...

45
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:45,063
That thing he found on my neck.

46
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,734
(machine whirring)

47
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,477
The tracer from
the creatures in the sky?

48
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:00,846
You still believe me, don't you?

49
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:02,949
Yeah, of course.

50
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,886
But it doesn't matter what I believe.

51
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:07,880
It does.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,895
Especially in this place.

53
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:10,823
Your story is who you are.

54
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:12,321
I wish I could forget my story.

55
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:14,610
No, you have to say it
out loud all the time

56
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,430
just to keep it straight in your head.

57
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,600
Tell me.

58
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:22,275
Tell me your story.
I won't judge you.

59
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:28,825
I can still hear the sound
if I let myself.

60
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,894
(rattling, distant thumping)

61
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,364
You hear something?

62
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,534
What's going on?

63
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:39,936
What time is it?

64
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:41,672
Stay here.

65
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,644
(floorboard creaking)

66
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,947
(clattering)

67
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:58,190
(floorboards creaking)

68
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,129
(clattering continues)

69
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,537
(screaming)

70
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:13,739
Grace...

71
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:14,906
(grunting)

72
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,791
Get back here!

73
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:38,229
(door slams)

74
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:44,737
(screams, whimpers)

75
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,977
I lost my father
and my stepmother that night.

76
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:54,847
I lost my stepsister the next day

77
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,783
when she accused me of murdering them.

78
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,955
Red and Patsy were secretly lovers.

79
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:04,290
They wanted the farm for themselves.

80
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:07,760
They planned every detail
to convince the police,

81
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:11,531
and no matter how many times
I told my story,

82
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:14,200
no one would believe me.

83
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:19,992
I believe you.

84
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,913
I loved the farm.

85
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:28,549
I miss the horses the most.

86
00:06:28,617 --> 00:06:31,118
The freedom I felt riding them.

87
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:33,821
Like I was flying.

88
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,123
You'll fly again.

89
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:45,700
Where did you go during
the movie, Lana?

90
00:06:45,768 --> 00:06:49,203
I... I told you,
I excused myself.

91
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,907
I'm not going to say a word
to Sister Jude.

92
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:54,376
I would have done that already

93
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:56,178
if I thought that's what was needed.

94
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,818
You reappeared.

95
00:07:02,886 --> 00:07:05,987
You, Kit and Grace.

96
00:07:06,055 --> 00:07:08,490
SISTER JUDE: <i>The Mexican,</i>

97
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,592
a sex-crazed deviant,

98
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,294
and a pinhead

99
00:07:12,362 --> 00:07:14,967
won't get far in this storm.

100
00:07:15,087 --> 00:07:17,164
I hope they all drown out there.

101
00:07:17,232 --> 00:07:19,275
Lights out in ten minutes.

102
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,602
(thunder crashing)
All right, let's go.

103
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:23,761
Shelley made it out.

104
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:24,996
She got past whatever's out there.

105
00:07:25,064 --> 00:07:26,498
What the hell were they?

106
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,233
We can never talk about that.

107
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:30,670
If they know we got out,
it's the end of us.

108
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,572
(thunder booming)

109
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:37,444
THREDSON:
<i>Here's the thing, Lana.</i>

110
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:40,347
You don't belong here.

111
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:42,649
You're not a danger to society.

112
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,852
You were right to try to escape.

113
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:46,754
(chuckles)

114
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,457
You headshrinkers are such hypocrites.

115
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:51,626
According to your bible,

116
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:54,762
the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical</i>
<i>Manual of Mental Disorders,</i>

117
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,230
I'm sick.

118
00:07:56,298 --> 00:07:58,833
I have an illness.

119
00:07:58,901 --> 00:08:01,702
I believe I can help you.

120
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,805
I'd like to try, if you'll let me.

121
00:08:03,872 --> 00:08:06,508
But I'm not even your patient.

122
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:09,810
I see myself in you.

123
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:11,324
You're thoughtful and intelligent.

124
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:13,547
You have something to offer the world.

125
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,493
And they can't keep you here

126
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:17,059
if they don't have
a current diagnosis.

127
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:18,730
If I can convince them
that I've cured you,

128
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,631
they'll be forced to release you.

129
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:22,966
Doctor, I have been this way since...

130
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,302
...since I can remember.

131
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,473
There is no cure.

132
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,413
Your choice.

133
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,146
I'm not like Sister Jude.

134
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:37,747
I won't force you to do anything.

135
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:39,148
But I also won't be here

136
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:40,616
very much longer... another week

137
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,219
if we're lucky...
so if you want help

138
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:43,420
getting out of this shithole...

139
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,389
...we'd better jump in.

140
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,606
You're a fish out of water, Lana,

141
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:50,693
gasping for life.

142
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,195
It won't end well.

143
00:08:52,262 --> 00:08:54,230
Trust me.

144
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,668
(upbeat French song
"Dominique" playing)

145
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,808
WOMAN: <i>15th of November 1964.</i>

146
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:07,221
<i>Dear Kitty:</i>

147
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,880
<i>This relentlessly cheerful tune</i>
<i>never stops playing.</i>

148
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:13,216
<i>The walls are closing in.</i>

149
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,352
<i>I can hardly breathe.</i>

150
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,187
<i>It's Amsterdam all over again.</i>

151
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,924
<i>But there are eyes everywhere.</i>

152
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:22,660
<i>These eyes of madness and disease.</i>

153
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,830
<i>These people,</i>
<i>they are resigned to die here.</i>

154
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,932
<i>We were never resigned.</i>

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,935
<i>We always held on to a shred of hope.</i>

156
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,471
Give me your pen.

157
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,741
If they catch you writing,
they'll throw you in solitary.

158
00:09:37,612 --> 00:09:39,566
In spite of the
religious icons everywhere,

159
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,445
this is a godless place.

160
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,348
You might want a friend.

161
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,585
Okay.

162
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,854
I hope you like pain.

163
00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:08,322
Ah.

164
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,840
You must be the new girl.

165
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,842
You were there.

166
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,410
What? In Auschwitz.

167
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:16,113
Nazi murderer!

168
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,014
You Nazi swine!

169
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:20,417
Take this one.
Murderer! Nazi swine!

170
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:23,152
(grunts) Don't you
remember me, Doctor?

171
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,854
I am Anne.

172
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,823
Anne Frank!

173
00:10:34,674 --> 00:10:36,708
SISTER JUDE:
So, Anne Frank, is it?

174
00:10:37,974 --> 00:10:40,820
What a relief it will be
to millions of schoolchildren

175
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:42,748
to know you survived.

176
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,717
You think I'm crazy.

177
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:46,037
Anne Frank died,

178
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:48,284
Bergen-Belsen, 1945.

179
00:10:48,404 --> 00:10:51,022
Just weeks before the camp
was liberated.

180
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,391
There were so many bodies
when the Allies arrived...

181
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:54,734
thousands...

182
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,662
buried in mass graves...
but I wasn't one of them.

183
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,030
I was too sick

184
00:10:59,097 --> 00:11:00,865
to tell anyone my name,

185
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:02,633
even if they had asked.

186
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,502
The Brits nursed us back
to some semblance of health.

187
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,737
Afterwards, I kept to

188
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:08,405
the streets in Germany.

189
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,007
A pickpocket, a thief.

190
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:11,241
And then I met a soldier.

191
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:13,243
Private William Snow
of Rutherford, New Jersey.

192
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,579
He saved me.

193
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:16,947
He brought me to America.

194
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:18,948
So you're a married lady.

195
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:20,750
A widow.

196
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,052
William was called back to service

197
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:24,020
during the Korean Conflict.

198
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,024
He was killed there in '52.

199
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:27,504
That same year,

200
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:29,372
my diary was published
here in America.

201
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:30,696
Only then did I realize

202
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,033
that Pim had survived the war.

203
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,040
And you made

204
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,305
no attempt to contact your father?

205
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:39,374
I wanted to,

206
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:40,312
at first.

207
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:43,010
But he had a new family, a new life.

208
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,979
But more than that, it was the diary.

209
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:45,980
People finally

210
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,147
started to pay attention

211
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:48,549
to what they'd done to us.

212
00:11:48,617 --> 00:11:49,917
All because of

213
00:11:49,985 --> 00:11:52,253
a martyred 15-year-old girl.

214
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,388
She had to stay 15.

215
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,823
And a martyr.

216
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:56,824
I could do

217
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:58,592
more good dead than alive.

218
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,060
Your story

219
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:01,896
is indecent.

220
00:12:01,963 --> 00:12:03,664
No, you are indecent.

221
00:12:03,732 --> 00:12:06,533
You have a Nazi war
criminal working here.

222
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,203
THREDSON: <i>I find myself in</i>

223
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,838
a bit of an ethical dilemma, Kit.

224
00:12:11,906 --> 00:12:14,107
If I deem you as sane,
you'll almost certainly

225
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:15,842
go to the electric chair, but if I...

226
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,745
judge you unfit to stand trial,

227
00:12:18,813 --> 00:12:21,448
you'll be allowed to live out
the rest of your days here.

228
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:25,018
So... what's the problem?

229
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:27,076
The problem is I don't
think you're crazy.

230
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,090
But I don't think you're evil.

231
00:12:29,157 --> 00:12:30,758
You think I'm innocent?

232
00:12:30,826 --> 00:12:32,893
In some ways, yes.

233
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,096
The innocent victim
of a brutish society

234
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:37,262
which drove you
to commit acts so terrible,

235
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,382
so... antithetical
to who you are

236
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:44,345
as a person that your psyche
concocted this elaborate fantasy

237
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:48,343
about alien abduction to
absolve you of your guilt.

238
00:12:48,411 --> 00:12:50,178
No.

239
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:51,346
That's not true.

240
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:52,614
I believe it is.

241
00:12:52,682 --> 00:12:53,945
But I also believe that your death

242
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,052
at the hands of the state
serves no moral purpose.

243
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,967
Listen to me very carefully, Kit.

244
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:03,659
I'm willing to lie to the courts
in order to save your life,

245
00:13:03,727 --> 00:13:06,001
but only under one condition:

246
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,191
That for the rest of
our time together,

247
00:13:08,311 --> 00:13:12,100
you face the truth
of what you've done.

248
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:14,203
If you can do that,

249
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,206
then I'll be able to leave here
feeling I've done some good.

250
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,808
I already told you what happened.

251
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:20,809
Yes.

252
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:22,711
Now let me tell you.

253
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:26,260
ANNE:
<i>He wasn't called Arden then.</i>

254
00:13:26,668 --> 00:13:28,237
He was Gruper.

255
00:13:28,596 --> 00:13:30,068
Hans Gruper.

256
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:31,553
He was SS.

257
00:13:31,673 --> 00:13:33,588
And he was not like the others.

258
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:36,558
I saw him the night we
arrived in Auschwitz.

259
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,560
That's where they sent us first.

260
00:13:38,628 --> 00:13:39,794
(train chugging)

261
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,900
(Arden speaking German)

262
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:50,372
<i>He seemed kind... gentle.</i>

263
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,742
<i>I remember that there were</i>
<i>two boys, twins,</i>

264
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,454
<i>and when the guards</i>
<i>herded the other children away,</i>

265
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:59,115
Gruper saved those twins.

266
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:02,331
<i>I can recall thinking</i>
<i>that they were lucky.</i>

267
00:14:05,122 --> 00:14:07,624
But nobody was lucky in Auschwitz.

268
00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:09,517
I didn't know it then,

269
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:12,462
but Dr. Gruper never
saved a single soul.

270
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:14,297
He would visit us regularly

271
00:14:14,365 --> 00:14:16,166
in the women's barracks,
bring us sweets,

272
00:14:16,234 --> 00:14:17,792
<i>chocolates.</i>

273
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:20,738
<i>The guards would never</i>
<i>strike us when he was present.</i>

274
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:23,346
<i>He wanted to help, he said.</i>

275
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:25,944
<i>But he couldn't treat</i>
<i>all the girls, he would say.</i>

276
00:14:26,011 --> 00:14:27,779
So he left it to chance.

277
00:14:37,623 --> 00:14:39,957
And when they came back,

278
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,626
if they came back...

279
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:45,102
...something had changed.

280
00:14:45,998 --> 00:14:47,906
<i>He had made them sick.</i>

281
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:51,436
<i>Whatever he'd done to them.</i>

282
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:53,705
<i>They'd be afraid to speak out.</i>
(girl sobbing)

283
00:14:53,773 --> 00:14:57,442
<i>They'd be sworn to secrecy.</i>

284
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,112
THREDSON:
<i>You married Alma in secret.</i>

285
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,715
You didn't feel you could tell anyone.

286
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:05,351
And as time passed, what
should've been your greatest joy

287
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,453
became your greatest shame.

288
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:09,789
And the pressure in you built
and needed a release.

289
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:12,358
And it found one.

290
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:16,463
On... January 16,

291
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:18,466
<i>Donna Burton, a librarian,</i>
<i>was abducted from</i>

292
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:20,095
<i>the Wausaukee County Library...</i>

293
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:23,203
<i>a short drive from the</i>
<i>gas station where you worked.</i>

294
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:28,209
Her remains were found two days later.

295
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:30,612
Her skin had been removed.

296
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,883
So had her head.

297
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:37,987
Why the skin, Kit?

298
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:40,155
Why the head?

299
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:40,884
I don't know.

300
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,517
Her race?

301
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:44,860
Her identity?
The very things about Alma

302
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:46,295
society was punishing you for?

303
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,196
No.

304
00:15:49,465 --> 00:15:52,434
It happened again in March.

305
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:55,269
Allison Rydell,

306
00:15:55,337 --> 00:15:58,172
a secretary, was taken
outside of her home.

307
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,174
Then it happened to Alma.

308
00:16:00,242 --> 00:16:02,643
The night it happened,

309
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,796
you said you had been
visited at work by friends.

310
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:08,495
<i>You said that they were suspicious,</i>

311
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:10,617
<i>that they followed you home.</i>

312
00:16:12,577 --> 00:16:14,221
But it wasn't them.

313
00:16:14,288 --> 00:16:16,490
Of course it was, Kit.

00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,125

You didn't see anything,

00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:21,122
<i>of the horrific mental health</i>
<i>abuses at Briarcliff Manor,</i>

334
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,008
<i>home for the criminally insane,</i>

335
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:25,705
<i>where she was held against her will</i>

336
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:29,231
and subjected to unspeakable torture,

337
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,800
the brave Miss Lana Winters.

338
00:17:31,867 --> 00:17:34,869
(applause)

339
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,011
Thank you.

340
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,416
I want to thank my real heroes:

341
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,385
The other inmates at Briarcliff,

342
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:53,156
whose stories broke my heart
and inspired me to survive.

343
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:55,525
Like Martha.

344
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:57,661
They say when she first arrived,

345
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:59,730
she was young and beautiful.

346
00:17:59,797 --> 00:18:01,632
She had suffered a nervous breakdown

347
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:03,066
after her husband committed suicide.

348
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:04,701
When I met her,

349
00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:05,936
she banged her head against the wall

350
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:07,704
pretty much every single day.

351
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:09,473
And Rudy.

352
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,944
Diagnosed as a chronic masturbator,

353
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:15,612
Sister Jude's cane did
little to help his habit.

354
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,180
In fact, he got worse.

355
00:18:18,716 --> 00:18:22,185
They tried hard to crush my spirit.

356
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:24,020
(screaming, electricity crackling)

357
00:18:26,123 --> 00:18:28,491
"Something there is
that doesn't love a wall"

358
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,635
(words echo quietly)

359
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:33,998
"That sends the
frozen-ground-swell under it,

360
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,776
And..."

361
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:40,671
<i>To destroy my mind</i>
<i>so I'd forget what I saw.</i>

362
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:43,875
"...the upper boulders
in the sun..."

363
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:47,179
(words echo quietly)

364
00:18:47,246 --> 00:18:51,249
I did everything
I could think of to survive.

365
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:59,892
<i>And then I did what I had to do</i>
<i>to get out.</i>

366
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:00,893
(swallows hard)

367
00:19:08,301 --> 00:19:10,335
How soon can we begin your therapy?

368
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:23,414
Are you seeing Sister Jude's
face in the dough?

369
00:19:23,482 --> 00:19:26,251
I want to punch her, too, for
making us work double shifts.

370
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,854
What if I am crazy?

371
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,473
Huh? What if I imagined
the whole thing?

372
00:19:31,593 --> 00:19:34,125
The spaceship,
the creatures, Alma abducted.

373
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,528
What if... what if
I made it all up

374
00:19:36,595 --> 00:19:38,463
because I couldn't face
up to what I'd done?

375
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:40,341
Why are you saying this now?

376
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:41,974
Dr. Thredson, he...

377
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:44,437
he said some things that
are starting to make sense.

378
00:19:44,504 --> 00:19:47,741
Well, if you were crazy,
they wouldn't make sense to you.

379
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:50,978
Self-doubt is
a sure sign of sanity.

380
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:53,581
Wait, you're confusing me.

381
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:56,851
If... you're saying
that if I'm crazy,

382
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,253
then I wouldn't believe
Dr. Thredson, but if I'm sane,

383
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,922
then my crazy stories would be true?

384
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:02,957
I have no idea what you just said.

385
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:08,863
What am I?

386
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,367
Crazy or sane?

387
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:17,906
Am I a killer?

388
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:21,643
I don't care.

389
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:23,779
Whatever you are,

390
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:26,681
I'll be with you.

391
00:20:55,076 --> 00:20:57,378
(moaning, panting)

392
00:21:02,684 --> 00:21:04,451
(grunting)

393
00:21:05,987 --> 00:21:07,621
(both panting)

394
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:08,955
(door opens)

395
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,513
I've taken the liberty
of choosing one, Sister Jude.

396
00:21:27,592 --> 00:21:31,528
A cane befitting
their... transgression.

397
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:34,365
I don't know what's gotten
into you lately, Sister,

398
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:36,856
but it's a decided improvement.

399
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:42,440
You two...
are far too familiar.

400
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:45,877
You're drawn to each other
like the serpent and the apple.

401
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:49,447
Are you purposely trying
to make a murder baby?

402
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:51,249
Grace didn't kill anyone.

403
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:53,942
She told me her story;
She was framed.

404
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:56,057
Just give us our beating
and get it over with.

405
00:21:56,177 --> 00:22:00,258
I think a more reliable step
needs to be taken:

406
00:22:00,326 --> 00:22:03,795
Sterilization, for the both of you.

407
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:05,569
You can't do that.

408
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,334
What is it?

409
00:22:09,402 --> 00:22:11,470
Two detectives are here
questioning Dr. Arden.

410
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,707
I don't know about what.

411
00:22:14,775 --> 00:22:15,775
Sister...

412
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:17,977
see to it that these two are secured

413
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:20,760
till the paperwork for
the procedure is approved.

414
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,148
FRANK:
I'll take 'em to solitary.

415
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,651
Frank... why don't you take
Grace, and I'll take Kit.

416
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,553
Would that be all right, Sister Jude?

417
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:28,104
Just make sure they're kept apart.

418
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:29,923
Come on. Let's go, get up.

419
00:22:29,991 --> 00:22:31,859
Let's go.

420
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,077
It's good advice, Kit.

421
00:22:45,696 --> 00:22:48,477
She's not the innocent girl
she claims to be.

422
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:58,053
Dr. Arden, I'd like
to go over with... oh.

423
00:22:59,322 --> 00:23:00,756
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

424
00:23:00,824 --> 00:23:02,691
I wasn't aware you had visitors.

425
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:04,694
I'm Sister Jude.

426
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:06,261
I run this facility.

427
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:08,664
Detective Byers.
This is Detective Connors.

428
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:10,432
Detectives. My gracious.

429
00:23:10,552 --> 00:23:13,102
This really doesn't
concern you, Sister.

430
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,971
Two police detectives questioning

431
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,873
one of my most valued staff members

432
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:19,375
concerns me greatly.
Maybe the sister can help.

433
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:22,078
A nun would make one
hell of a character witness.

434
00:23:22,145 --> 00:23:24,946
If it's a question of the doctor's
character, I've got lots to say.

435
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,233
Well, your colleague here

436
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,868
has been accused of roughing up

437
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:29,136
a certain lady of the evening.

438
00:23:30,538 --> 00:23:31,632
A prostitute?!

439
00:23:31,763 --> 00:23:34,765
No need to retire to your
fainting couch, Sister.

440
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:37,301
Because all of this
is an egregious lie.

441
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,737
I've never even met the woman.

442
00:23:39,804 --> 00:23:43,407
It must have been frightening,
meeting strange men,

443
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:45,651
what with a killer on the loose.

444
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:48,445
She says she saw some things
which alarmed her.

445
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:49,493
<i>Obscene material,</i>

446
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:51,382
<i>pornography...</i>

447
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,452
<i>...Nazi memorabilia.</i>

448
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,254
When she tried to leave his home,

449
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,655
he got physical with her.

450
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,956
No!

451
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,562
This is utter hogwash.
I was here.

452
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:07,163
Can you verify that for us, Sister?

453
00:24:07,231 --> 00:24:08,855
Did you say Nazi memorabilia?

454
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,360
This is outrageous.

455
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,737
I have no idea what
I'm even being accused of.

456
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:14,971
One would think that

457
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,983
the Wausaukee County Police Department

458
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:19,543
would have something
better to do with its time.

459
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,877
I know I have.

460
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:23,365
Good day to you.

461
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:27,350
Aren't you going to arrest him?

462
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:30,928
For what?
Well, you're the Vice detectives.

463
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,256
Actually, Sister, we're Homicide.

464
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,458
Homicide?

465
00:24:35,526 --> 00:24:38,895
Certain details of the victim's
statement caught our eye.

466
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,363
Maybe we can ask you a question.

467
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:41,698
It's about one of your patients here,

468
00:24:41,766 --> 00:24:43,418
Kit Walker. What about him?

469
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:44,901
He seemed like the kind of guy

470
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:47,377
that would have the surgical
skill to remove a woman's skin?

471
00:24:49,173 --> 00:24:50,340
And her head?

472
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,149
(stifled retch)

473
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:12,062
What is this stuff?
Apomorphine.

474
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:14,164
The standard drug

475
00:25:14,232 --> 00:25:15,766
for this kind of cutting-edge
aversion therapy.

476
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:18,033
They use it at Harvard,
Brigham Young, Cornell.

477
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:20,170
The theory is that we're
training your body

478
00:25:20,238 --> 00:25:22,473
to be physically repelled
by certain...

479
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:24,761
triggers.

480
00:25:36,021 --> 00:25:38,689
How did you get that?

481
00:25:38,757 --> 00:25:41,425
From your house, when I was there.

482
00:25:41,493 --> 00:25:43,325
I thought you might want it.

483
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,230
Say when.

484
00:25:54,071 --> 00:25:55,371
(shuddering)

485
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:03,979
I need a few more minutes...

486
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:06,682
I need a few minutes
before the next one.

487
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,252
I'm very impressed with
your determination, Lana.

488
00:26:10,475 --> 00:26:12,588
Let's take a break from that.

489
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,459
Let's move on to the conversion part

490
00:26:16,526 --> 00:26:17,640
of your therapy.

491
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,528
I think you might
actually enjoy this part.

492
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,789
You know Daniel.

493
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:33,375
I've asked him to help out
with your treatment.

494
00:26:33,443 --> 00:26:35,944
He told me that he thinks
you're a very good person,

495
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,312
and he would be honored

496
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,647
to participate

497
00:26:38,714 --> 00:26:39,981
in anything that might liberate you.

498
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,279
Whatever you say, Doctor.

499
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:45,153
I want to do whatever works.

500
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:47,455
Good.

501
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,022
Let's get started, then.
Daniel...

502
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:50,425
We'll begin with

503
00:26:50,493 --> 00:26:51,927
very simple visual stimulation.

504
00:26:51,995 --> 00:26:53,589
Daniel will take off his robe,

505
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,965
and you will regard his physique.

506
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,409
(panting)

507
00:27:08,812 --> 00:27:10,579
I'm sorry, but...

508
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:13,215
I don't feel anything.

509
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:15,551
That's okay.

510
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:17,586
You're not gonna make
him touch me, are you?

511
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:20,122
Actually, I'm going to ask you...

512
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,857
to touch yourself.

513
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:26,161
Can you do that?

514
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:28,497
I don't know...

515
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:45,312
Try to focus on his genitals.

516
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:53,220
THREDSON: Good.

517
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:56,590
Good, Lana.

518
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:58,226
Now, take your other hand

519
00:27:58,294 --> 00:27:59,828
and place it on Daniel's member.

520
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,729
(gasping)

521
00:28:01,797 --> 00:28:03,798
(exhaling sharply)

522
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:12,473
Good.

523
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:17,145
Good. Now keep
touching yourself

524
00:28:17,212 --> 00:28:21,148
and try to relate the
pleasure that you're feeling

525
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,650
to his tumescence.

526
00:28:22,718 --> 00:28:24,152
(sobs)

527
00:28:26,689 --> 00:28:27,599
(panting)

528
00:28:27,719 --> 00:28:29,124
You're doing good work, Lana.

529
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,258
(gasps, sobs)

530
00:28:30,326 --> 00:28:31,717
We're all rooting for you.

531
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:35,196
Oh!

532
00:28:35,264 --> 00:28:36,831
(vomits)

533
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:41,169
Give me a few minutes!
Please just

534
00:28:41,237 --> 00:28:42,437
give me a few more seconds!

535
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:43,939
I know I can do it!

536
00:28:44,006 --> 00:28:45,407
In a perfect world,

537
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,909
I would love to dive
into talk therapy,

538
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,878
discover the root of your fixation,

539
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:53,448
but my expertise is telling me
that aversion/conversion therapy

540
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:54,449
won't work with you.

541
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:56,584
(whimpers)

542
00:28:57,504 --> 00:28:59,887
Sister Jude, we need to talk.

543
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:02,490
Yes, I agree.

544
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,181
The police came
to Briarcliff last night.

545
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:10,067
It seems
Dr. Arden solicited a...

546
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,660
a woman of the night.

547
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:17,573
The young woman found
Nazi souvenirs in his bedroom.

548
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,324
Are the police pursuing
a case against him?

549
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:23,245
No, I don't believe so, but...

550
00:29:23,313 --> 00:29:29,084
Sister, this obsession with
Dr. Arden has to stop.

551
00:29:29,152 --> 00:29:32,055
But there's mounting evidence
that this man is a war criminal.

552
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:32,988
Just a moment.

553
00:29:33,496 --> 00:29:35,730
Where are you getting
this information?

554
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:39,834
There is a patient who
survived the death camps.

555
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:41,669
She remembers him.

556
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,270
Which patient is this?

557
00:29:43,338 --> 00:29:45,110
Her name is Anne.

558
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,520
Anne who?

559
00:29:48,544 --> 00:29:49,878
Anne Frank.

560
00:29:49,945 --> 00:29:53,115
I know it... I know how
it sounds, but you...

561
00:29:53,183 --> 00:29:54,917
No, I really don't think you do.

562
00:29:54,985 --> 00:29:56,686
(whispers):
I saw a prison tattoo.

563
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,290
She was in Auschwitz.

564
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,322
Where's she now, hiding in the attic?

565
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,666
You're so eager
to believe any calumny,

566
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:05,394
any vile thing said
about this man you despise

567
00:30:05,462 --> 00:30:08,810
that you're taking the word of
an inmate in a mental ward.

568
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,333
Father, this isn't about me.

569
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:16,267
I am trying to protect you,
this institution, our dream!

570
00:30:16,387 --> 00:30:17,478
You imperil the dream, Sister,

571
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:19,519
by refusing to face your own failures.

572
00:30:19,742 --> 00:30:22,378
You'd rather see Nazi war
criminals in our midst

573
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,846
than look in the mirror.

574
00:30:23,914 --> 00:30:26,582
Or maybe this job is too much for you.

575
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,851
No, this job means everything to me.

576
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,116
You know that.

577
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:33,456
All I know is that you've
been drinking again.

578
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:43,052
Several of our employees witnessed
you were a drunken fool

579
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,746
on the night of the escape,

580
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:49,606
slurring your words, almost slobbering

581
00:30:49,673 --> 00:30:54,778
during the introduction of the
film from your movie night.

582
00:30:54,845 --> 00:30:58,348
Do you think alcohol has compromised

583
00:30:58,415 --> 00:31:00,175
your judgment in these matters?

584
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:02,185
You don't need to answer now.

585
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:03,787
Reflect.

586
00:31:07,122 --> 00:31:08,384
Pray on it.

587
00:31:18,903 --> 00:31:22,071
(phone ringing)

588
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:24,107
Hello.

589
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:26,137
They're on to you, Arthur.

590
00:31:26,257 --> 00:31:28,945
If you have any housekeeping
to take care of,

591
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,514
I suggest you do it now.

592
00:31:31,582 --> 00:31:33,850
(wheezing)

593
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:51,328
Mother Superior, I have slipped.

594
00:31:51,448 --> 00:31:52,618
Oh, dear.

595
00:31:53,491 --> 00:31:57,389
Pressures had mounted all around me,

596
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,326
and then this
God-forsaken storm.

597
00:32:01,826 --> 00:32:03,829
And somehow there was a carafe

598
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:06,910
of communion wine left in my office.

599
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,358
That's how God is.
He loves to test us.

600
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:12,204
Well, I failed.

601
00:32:12,272 --> 00:32:14,140
And now he's giving
you another opportunity.

602
00:32:14,207 --> 00:32:16,475
God loves to see us triumph.

603
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,244
It gives Him pleasure.

604
00:32:19,085 --> 00:32:21,618
Was your alcoholic
transgression the only reason

605
00:32:21,738 --> 00:32:23,449
you sought my counsel today, my child?

606
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:24,450
(wry laugh)

607
00:32:24,518 --> 00:32:26,019
No, Mother.

608
00:32:28,356 --> 00:32:30,950
There's an employee of Briarcliff

609
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:33,226
who I believe is a sadist

610
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:36,229
and possibly a war criminal.

611
00:32:36,297 --> 00:32:39,114
Have you brought this to the
attention of your monsignor?

612
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:43,536
He has declined to pursue
justice or action.

613
00:32:43,604 --> 00:32:45,471
The men of our church...

614
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:49,342
your Monsignor Timothy,
even the Holy Father himself,

615
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:51,243
by their very nature
they react out of fear

616
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:52,978
when confronted with tough questions.

617
00:32:53,046 --> 00:32:54,613
It's their instinct
to protect themselves,

618
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,415
cover their mistakes.

619
00:32:56,483 --> 00:32:59,317
Now, I'm familiar with
somebody who may help you.

620
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:05,557
Oh, no, Mother, I cannot,
I will not go behind the back

621
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,091
of the man who gave me
my mission in life;

622
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,428
Who believed in me;

623
00:33:08,548 --> 00:33:10,528
With whom I share a dream.

624
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:14,038
He is not who made you
who you are, Jude.

625
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,959
You came to me a tortured woman,

626
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,861
ravaged by alcohol and guilt,

627
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,329
but you had a compass.

628
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:20,453
That was your gift.

629
00:33:20,573 --> 00:33:22,750
And God gave you that
gift for a purpose.

630
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,894
Now he's put obstacles in your path,

631
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:28,000
and like all this debris
after the storm,

632
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:31,141
it's up to you to make
clear that path again.

633
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:39,049
(outer door opens, rattles)

634
00:33:40,918 --> 00:33:41,751
(outer door shuts)

635
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:01,169
(door shuts)

636
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:03,104
(gasping anxiously)

637
00:34:03,172 --> 00:34:05,006
Kit?

638
00:34:05,074 --> 00:34:07,175
Kit, are you all right?

639
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:09,344
Did they... Cut my balls off?

640
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,579
Not yet.

641
00:34:11,647 --> 00:34:13,180
(laughs quietly)

642
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:15,349
I was so worried.

643
00:34:15,417 --> 00:34:17,919
You are the only person I ever
had a second thought about

644
00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:19,220
in this hellhole.

645
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:20,788
Why'd you lie to me, Grace?

646
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:22,871
There was no man named Red.

647
00:34:23,155 --> 00:34:25,960
You killed your stepmother
and then your father.

648
00:34:26,028 --> 00:34:27,361
What do you want?

649
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,930
You want to hear me

650
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:29,981
say I'm sorry for what I've done?

651
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:30,896
I'm not sorry.

652
00:34:31,016 --> 00:34:31,750
(bangs on wall)

653
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,268
Tell me the truth!

654
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,141
(sighs deeply)

655
00:34:44,747 --> 00:34:46,848
I was so young when it started.

656
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:52,621
My father would come
into my room at night...

657
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:53,989
and do things.

658
00:34:57,526 --> 00:34:58,863
(door creaking)

659
00:34:58,983 --> 00:35:01,399
<i>Sometimes I felt like</i>
<i>I was in a dream,</i>

660
00:35:01,757 --> 00:35:04,863
<i>watching him do it to a stranger,</i>

661
00:35:05,735 --> 00:35:08,037
<i>or a corpse.</i>

662
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:12,975
<i>I finally got the courage</i>
<i>to tell my stepmother.</i>

663
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:14,443
(scrubbing)

664
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:16,912
<i>She gave me candy to keep quiet.</i>

665
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,747
(scrubbing continues)

666
00:35:23,518 --> 00:35:24,351
(screams)

667
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:39,299
There was truth to the story
I told before, Kit.

668
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:41,837
I loved my horses.

669
00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:44,504
They were my escape.

670
00:35:44,572 --> 00:35:47,441
(sighs)

671
00:35:47,508 --> 00:35:50,544
I found out he sold them all.

672
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:53,046
(panting heavily)

673
00:35:58,687 --> 00:35:59,620
Patsy...

674
00:36:00,455 --> 00:36:01,855
(shrieking)

675
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:08,895
That's when I woke up

676
00:36:08,963 --> 00:36:11,098
and saw my life for what it was.

677
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:15,369
And once I opened my eyes,
there was no turning back.

678
00:36:26,748 --> 00:36:29,016
Have I opened your eyes, Kit?

679
00:36:29,084 --> 00:36:31,819
Are you repulsed by what I am?

680
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:33,254
No.

681
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,924
I admire you.

682
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:52,973
("Dominique" playing)

683
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,912
(woman wailing in distance)

684
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:07,757
I want to talk to you.

685
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:08,976
I haven't been able to sleep

686
00:37:09,096 --> 00:37:11,194
since you left my office.

687
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:12,195
(sighs)

688
00:37:12,262 --> 00:37:13,496
I'm so sorry, Lana.

689
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,856
I wish I had been a real help.

690
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:18,146
I'm not an aversion therapy advocate,

691
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:21,871
but I thought it made
sense in the moment.

692
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,339
Now I wish I'd spared you.

693
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,942
You tried.

694
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:31,981
I brought you this.

695
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,387
Thought you'd want it.

696
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,622
(whispering):
They'll never let me keep this.

697
00:37:41,094 --> 00:37:43,717
You only have to hide it
until the end of the week.

698
00:37:45,288 --> 00:37:47,541
I'm leaving here on Friday
and I am taking you with me.

699
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:49,865
I don't know how yet, but...

700
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:52,743
I will not leave you
in this place, Lana.

701
00:37:52,965 --> 00:37:54,637
That's a promise.

702
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:05,347
SISTER JUDE: <i>I understand</i>
<i>you want to confess.</i>

703
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:09,680
I can only regard this as a ploy,

704
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:11,315
considering the circumstances.

705
00:38:11,382 --> 00:38:13,650
You were, after all,
caught in the act.

706
00:38:13,718 --> 00:38:18,349
No, uh, Sister, this is, uh,
this is not about Grace and me.

707
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:19,920
This is about my crimes.

708
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:23,493
Your crimes.

709
00:38:23,561 --> 00:38:25,162
Yeah.

710
00:38:25,229 --> 00:38:26,897
And I know I'm not
a very religious man,

711
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,721
but I did go to Sunday School,

712
00:38:29,788 --> 00:38:32,156
and I was taught
that God sees everything.

713
00:38:32,224 --> 00:38:33,691
Is that true?

714
00:38:33,759 --> 00:38:35,693
It is. And He does.

715
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,295
Even if I might not remember

716
00:38:37,363 --> 00:38:39,998
some terrible act
that I might have committed?

717
00:38:40,065 --> 00:38:41,132
He knows, right?

718
00:38:43,235 --> 00:38:44,068
(tires screeching, crashing)

719
00:38:46,071 --> 00:38:46,971
God knows all.

720
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:48,806
Well, then He knows...

721
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,675
if I murdered those women.

722
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:54,546
He knows if I... if I did
those horrible things.

723
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:59,251
And He knows if I killed Alma.

724
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:00,852
Did you?

725
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,187
I must have.

726
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:03,822
I mean...

727
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:05,490
(cries quietly)

728
00:39:05,558 --> 00:39:08,360
...everyone's saying that I did.

729
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:09,594
(sobbing quietly)

730
00:39:09,662 --> 00:39:10,962
And those creatures, the creatures,

731
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,263
they can't really exist.

732
00:39:12,331 --> 00:39:14,833
I remember when
I first showed up here,

733
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:17,169
you said to me that,
in order to find forgiveness,

734
00:39:17,237 --> 00:39:19,339
that I had to... (sobs)

735
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:21,975
that I had to... that I had
to admit to what I'd done.

736
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,710
Sister...

737
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:26,914
I need to be forgiven.

738
00:39:28,884 --> 00:39:30,351
God forgives all who seek Him.

739
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:31,419
Then help me.

740
00:39:31,487 --> 00:39:32,757
Please.

741
00:39:32,877 --> 00:39:34,589
Help me find God.

742
00:39:34,709 --> 00:39:37,491
I'll admit to everything that I've done.
My child...

743
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:42,530
...we're all sinners,
every one of us.

744
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,765
But the things I've done, Sister...

745
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,433
That you can't recall.

746
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:47,868
(crying)

747
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:51,604
(grunting)

748
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:58,190
Now, what have you been
saying about me?

749
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,714
The truth. I know who you are!

750
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,827
(scoffs)

751
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,715
You don't even know who you are.

752
00:40:03,782 --> 00:40:06,918
Anne Frank?! She died!

753
00:40:06,985 --> 00:40:08,853
Or didn't you bother to read the book?

754
00:40:10,722 --> 00:40:13,624
Your lies have caused me
a great deal of embarrassment.

755
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:15,412
What are you going to do to me?

756
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:18,761
The same things you did to
those girls in Auschwitz? Huh?

757
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:22,237
I was never in Auschwitz.
I'm from Scottsdale!

758
00:40:22,357 --> 00:40:25,302
Liar! I bet it looked
a lot like this place!

759
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,570
You want to know what goes on in here?

760
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:29,372
You're about to find out.

761
00:40:37,616 --> 00:40:39,434
Where'd you get that?

762
00:40:39,554 --> 00:40:42,053
I'm not the only one who's on to you.

763
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:46,024
Oh... oh, sorry. (Laughs)

764
00:40:47,093 --> 00:40:49,061
Come on...

765
00:40:49,129 --> 00:40:50,963
now's the time.

766
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:53,699
Confess, Hans Gruper.

767
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:55,901
Nazi piece of shit.

768
00:40:55,969 --> 00:40:57,536
(clattering, thudding)

769
00:40:57,603 --> 00:40:58,570
What's that?

770
00:40:58,638 --> 00:41:00,605
(gunshot, Arden yells in pain)

771
00:41:00,673 --> 00:41:01,773
Bitch! What is in that room?

772
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,888
Go to hell. I've been there.

773
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,110
Give me the key. (Spits)

774
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:08,778
(yells in pain) Give me the key!

775
00:41:08,898 --> 00:41:10,881
Want to lose another leg?

776
00:41:15,853 --> 00:41:17,353
(lock clicks, door creaks)

777
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:21,992
Kill me.
