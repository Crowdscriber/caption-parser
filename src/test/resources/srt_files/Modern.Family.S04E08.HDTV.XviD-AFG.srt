1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,800
And we have... lift-off.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,480
Yello, house of the future.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,050
Phil, you have two
whole days to yourself.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,320
Please tell me you're not
gonna spend them

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,320
trying to wire the house
to your iPad.

6
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,220
Nope, 'cause I've already done it.

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,490
I think when you get home,
you're gonna be very surprised to see

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,060
that this house has an actual
functioning brain in it.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,480
Great. Great.
Now go out and see some friends.

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm headed out now.

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,690
I have a third showing
at that colonial.

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,740
Cam gave me
a free pass to his gym.

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,300
I am... not too bright.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,370
I am... dim!

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,750
Honey, if you could hear yourself.

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,370
Promise me you'll go
outside and play.

17
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,050
Miss you, too.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,610
Phil Dunphy,
this is the year 2025.

19
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,720
Welcome.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,420
You're the first one here.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,074

23
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,980
Shall we hit the waterslide first?

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,540
I may just sit
in the room for a bit.

25
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,820
Stop moping!

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,990
So you didn't get a date
to one stupid dance.

27
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,070
It's not one stupid dance.

28
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,170
It's the kickoff to
the whole dance season.

29
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,830
It's like you've never
heard boys talk.

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,960
We are here for
the academic challenge.

31
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,830
It's under "Dunphy."

32
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,460
Or it could be under
"returning champion."

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,840
Not sure how they file these things.

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,000
Alex wins things, which is great.

35
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,300
But she puts so much
pressure on herself.

36
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,920
I... I almost wish
she would lose this year.

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,710
Plus, that way,
I could go on the waterslide.

38
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,450
It's got a corkscrew,
2-second freefall,

39
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,130
and a radar gun at the bottom.

40
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,670
I'm Phil.

41
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,000
Nothing from the minibar,

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,650
- and no pay-per-view.
- Can we at least...

43
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,010
No, you may not send
things out for pressing.

44
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,440
Honey, we have an hour
until the competition.

45
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,990
Do you want to go
to the contestants mixer?

46
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,730
No, I don't want to humanize them.

47
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,170
Can you believe this
is my first bar mitzvah?

48
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,700
You'll love it. I heard
the gift bags have smartphones.

49
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,220
Jewish people are so awesome.

50
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,880
Oh, my God. Did you see that?

51
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,080
She smiled at me.

52
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,880
People get that way
in dance season.

53
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,030
No girl's ever smiled
at me like that.

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,730
Luke, we have to go
to that bar mitzvah.

55
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,990
- Why?
- There was a connection.

56
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,750
I know this sounds crazy,

57
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,790
but I feel like my whole life
has led to this moment.

58
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,770
You made a very similar speech to get
my mom to stop for those churros.

59
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,120
Luke, I need you for this.

60
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,450
You're sneakier than I am.

61
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,650
You're a bigger liar.

62
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,210
You have no moral compass.

63
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,850
Look, thanks for
all the compliments,

64
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,410
but breaking into one stupid party?

65
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,900
That's not even a challenge.

66
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,520
Oh, no. Three bar mitzvahs?

67
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,740
Now it's interesting.

68
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,610
- Cam, stop.
- What?

69
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,980
We have to get them out of there.

70
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,490
What's taking them?

71
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,250
We have the most amazing gift
for Jay and Gloria's nursery.

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,210
It was Cam's idea, and
it's a pretty big swing.

73
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,000
It's not a swing.
It's not a swing.

74
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,650
I just need Jay and Gloria out of
the house for a minimum of four hours

75
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,520
- so I can have my crew install it.
- Simple.

76
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:58,420
Please. If it were up to you,

77
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,430
we'd get them something
off their gift registry.

78
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,580
You mean the list of things that

79
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,330
they specifically said
that they wanted?

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,480
They don't know what they want.

81
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,170
...before I snap his finger off!

82
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,610
Ay, no.
Jay was supposed to cancel.

83
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,130
- We cannot go to lunch.
- No.

84
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,930
I am sorry, but he's supposed
to pick up the crib at the store,

85
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,210
and I am too tired.

86
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,320
The baby kicked me all night.

87
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,960
It's either going to be
a football player or a chorus girl.

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,240
You can be both.
My senior year,

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,380
I was a right-side linebacker

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,740
and a left-side cancan
dancer in "Gigi."

91
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,250
She really set you up
for that one, didn't she?

92
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,570
Yeah, when it came out of her mouth,
I nearly stopped breathing.

93
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,520
You didn't call them to cancel.

94
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,030
Sorry. You want gas money?

95
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,250
Don't pay attention to him.

96
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,070
He's been very grumpy lately.

97
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,110
Okay, here's a thought.

98
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,160
Mitchell, you go
to the crib store with Jay.

99
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,420
That way I can spend some
quality time with this pretty lady.

100
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,570
No, I'm going to lay down.

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,690
No, no, I'm gonna
take you both to lunch.

102
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,030
Okay? There, it's settled.

103
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,640
Now go put a lip on. Okay?

104
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,470
Fine.
I guess you won't get in the way.

105
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,670
You mean it, pa?

106
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,850
Really and for true?

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,560
I won't get in the way?

108
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,210
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah. The chairs are rocks.

109
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,860
Charlemagne.

110
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,090
You can get a 1-day cushion
for $8, or a 2-day for $12.

111
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,930
Alex Dunphy.

112
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,150
Last year, I got 2
1-dayers-big mistake.

113
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,600
Who wrote the 95 theses?

114
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,800
My daughter went on
to win the whole thing,

115
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,930
and all I could think was
"I just flushed $4 down the toilet."

116
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,290
John Calvin.

117
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,140
Alex!

118
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,890
I guess I just
didn't want to presume

119
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,020
that we would be here
for the two days.

120
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,000
But still, what kind of message
was I sending with the 1-dayer?

121
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,260
You "whoo'd" me?

122
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,420
What are you doing here?

123
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,870
I'm out.
I got the question wrong,

124
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,880
which is embarrassing enough
without you "whoo-ing" me!

125
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,240
Alex! Alex, come back here.

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,230
Don't!

127
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,210
Wait, what are the last
four numbers again?

128
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,780
1-9-8-4.

129
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,220
It's kind of a lucky number for me.

130
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,810
It's the year "Footloose" came out.

131
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,140
Yeah. And I really am gonna
call you for that rematch.

132
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,130
Anytime.

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,540
I mean, not super late, but...

134
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,870
- Wait, you're a bulldog?
- Yeah. You?

135
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,830
I knew there was something
about you I liked.

136
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,810
You mean besides me
letting you win?

137
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,160
You know, we have
a big game today.

138
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,510
- You wanna watch it together?
- Well...

139
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,790
Shoot.
I'm-- I'm late for a showing.

140
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,320
No pressure at all,
but if you feel like it,

141
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,470
we could watch it at my place.

142
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,110
I could text you the address.

143
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,460
All right. Well, thanks.
It was great meeting you, Phil.

144
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,170
You, too, Dave.

145
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,110
It's me.

146
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,140
Yeah, you were totally
right about this gym.

147
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,290
- I just met the cutest guy.
- What did I tell you?

148
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,760
That place is like
a gay bar with dumbbells.

149
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Redundant.

150
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,060
Well, I don't know much about him,

151
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,720
but he invited me over to his place
to watch a football game tonight.

152
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,780
Oh, my gosh, a date.

153
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,560
I have a good feeling about this.

154
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,170
Well, don't start planning
the wedding yet.

155
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,680
I mean, I'm not even sure
if it's a date date.

156
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,820
You met him at hook-up central.

157
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,170
Of course it's a date date.

158
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,670
Am I even ready for a date date?

159
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,900
Tough love time, David,
Simon left you six months ago,

160
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,110
and you're bumming everyone out.

161
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,150
It's time to get back up
on that horse.

162
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,780
Hope to see you tonight, Dave.

163
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,380
I can't remember the last time
a man made that sound for me.

164
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,620
She's not here. We have
the wrong bar mitzvah.

165
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,770
Not if you like prime rib, bubbie.

166
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,000
You said to blend.

167
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,250
I picked up some expressions
at the latke station.

168
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,240
P.S. they're hash browns.

169
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,300
We're not blending.

170
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,710
She's at one of the other two.
Come on.

171
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
Sorry.

172
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,980
Such a hurry, this one.

173
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,540
Come on.

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,970
That's too cute.

175
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,480
What the hell is that?

176
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,930
That's the store mascot.
That's Hugga Bunny.

177
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,110
- He goes around and he hugs...
- No, I get it.

178
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,760
Nice for flu season.

179
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,240
He ought to be called
conjunctivitis bunny.

180
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,430
Okay.

181
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,930
So, dad, the cribs are over there,
but while we're here,

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,380
a little advice, you can never
have too many onesies. All right?

183
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:49,970
Any event, day or night.

184
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,600
Throw one on, little pair of booties,
boom-ready to go out.

185
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,020
Dress it up,
you could dress it down.

186
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,690
You could-- Dad?

187
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,510
Dad?

188
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,540
Something was clearly
going on with my dad,

189
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,470
but I wasn't about
to get sucked in.

190
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,810
It's happened before.

191
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,930
"Dad, you seem sad.
Do you wanna talk?"

192
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,200
"Talk?! What are we, girlfriends?"

193
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,850
To use a sports reference,
put the football away, Lucy.

194
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,300
I ain't kickin'.

195
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,480
So Saturday noon?

196
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,770
- Saturday noon's fine, Jay.
- Yeah.

197
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,620
Dad, I picked you up a diaper bag.

198
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,790
Fun fact... this insulated pouch
will keep a bottle of

199
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,680
prosecco cold for
an entire Wiggles concert.

200
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,430
- Mitch, it's doctor...
- Bob Jensen.

201
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,540
Nice to meet you.

202
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,540
- Jay, I will see you.
- Yeah, I'll see you then.

203
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,120
Good, Bob.

204
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,750
Doctor? Sweater vest?
My dad acting all shifty?

205
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,530
He was seeing a shrink.

206
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,910
"Dad, I can see that you're
going through something."

207
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,220
"And I can see your bra strap, Oprah.
Mind your own business."

208
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,810
Tee up the football
all you want, Lucy.

209
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,240
Still ain't kickin'.

210
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,770
She clearly misheard the question.

211
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,980
The acoustics in here are terrible.

212
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,630
Especially for a little girl just
getting over an ear infection.

213
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,870
- Oh, my God, what are you doing?
- I was explaining your--

214
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,570
I heard, because my ears are fine.

215
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,170
I'm sorry. I didn't ask her to do this.

216
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,670
- I'm trying to help you.
- You were not.

217
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,060
You were trying to help you.

218
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,110
You're just mad
because now you can't

219
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,620
parade me around
like some show pony.

220
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,720
- That is not true.
- Don't deny it.

221
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,580
You bought the 2-day cushion.

222
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,800
Who are you to judge?

223
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you for a fun day, okay?

224
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,420
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye?

225
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,680
Cam, sorry,
but the lunch was two hours,

226
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,510
and then you had to show me
your first apartment.

227
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,530
Could you believe 
how I used to live?

228
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,940
I really need to take a nap now.

229
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,190
No. No, no. No. No. No, no.

230
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,810
You know what? I have,
something I want you to do

231
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,110
that's even more
relaxing than a nap.

232
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,770
No. I want to take a nap.

233
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,390
- There's my man.
- That's me. Your man.

234
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,660
I brought spinach dip.
I don't know why.

235
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,030
I'll tell you why.
'Cause it's delicious,

236
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,940
and you're an awesome guest.
Get in here.

237
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,900
- All right.
- How are you?

238
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,400
- Good. You?
- Good.

239
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,140
By the way, I left a message
for my brother-in-law

240
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,090
and his partner to join us, too.

241
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,330
More people. Good.

242
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,590
- Nice house, by the way.
- Thanks.

243
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,510
Wait a minute.
Is that your family?

244
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,640
Are you married?

245
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,390
Yeah, but don't worry.
We have the house to ourselves.

246
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,580
They're all out of town.

247
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,950
I am long overdue
for a boys' night.

248
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,640
So your wife is okay with--

249
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,920
Oh yeah. She suggested it.

250
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,860
She knows I need this
every so often.

251
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,600
Long as I clean up
afterwards, she's fine.

252
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,040
You ready for a margarita?

253
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,790
Sure.

254
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,310
Soothing, right?

255
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,750
You see, as the music
relaxes the baby, you relax.

256
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,270
No, you're making the baby
jump on my bladder.

257
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,630
How can it relax listening
to a song about a hooker?

258
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,550
She's not a hooker,
she's a private dancer.

259
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,720
A dancer for money.
She'll do what you want her to--

260
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,760
Oh, my gosh,
I taught Lily this song.

261
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,420
Excuse me. Hello?

262
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,730
He's married.
To a woman.

263
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,670
Yeah, she's out of town.

264
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,750
I don't know. They must have some
sort of arrangement or something.

265
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,810
So what? If they know
about it, who cares?

266
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,240
You're not ready
for a relationship anyway.

267
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,610
Just have some fun.

268
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,890
It feels weird.

269
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,160
He has other people coming over.

270
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,720
I think I'm gonna bail on this.

271
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,500
He's just feeling you out
like you're feeling him out.

272
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,740
I promise you, these other
guests will mysteriously cancel.

273
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,610
Hold on just a second, sweetie.

274
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,380
- Hello?
- You guys still coming?

275
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,250
I forgot to call you.
We have to cancel.

276
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,440
No problem. Bye.

277
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,950
More margaritas for us.
The other guys just cancelled.

278
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,080
Are you still there?

279
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,520
You were right.
The other guys just cancelled.

280
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,850
See? Now listen to me.

281
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,050
You're gonna have two margaritas.

282
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,240
Maybe start a third.

283
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,700
Laugh at his jokes.

284
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,030
But not in that high falsetto thing.

285
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,690
Something more manly.
Let's practice.

286
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,030
I'm not gonna laugh for you.

287
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,050
You can be very controlling,
you know that?

288
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,550
Why does everybody
say I'm controlling?

289
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,020
Gotta go.

290
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,010
Looks like this kennel
is for bulldogs only.

291
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,780
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

292
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,220
- I'm great.
- Oh, good.

293
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,140
Listen, I-I don't want this
to sound weird, but, um...

294
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,650
But you and I, tonight...

295
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,240
Is this, uh...

296
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,000
Sorry, Dave, what was that?

297
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,820
Nothing.

298
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,240
Here you go.

299
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,900
For a small fee, we can come
to your house and assemble it for you.

300
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,710
Yeah, my dad's more
of a do-it-yourself-er,

301
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,160
plus he's not one for strangers
in his personal space.

302
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,330
All right.

303
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,700
Well, can I help you
carry it to your car?

304
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,260
Yeah, he's not gonna go
for that, either.

305
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,330
The guy won't even use
the wheels on his suitcase.

306
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,260
Likes everyone to think
he's this big, tough guy who-

307
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,620
Okay.

308
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,840
There he is. All right.
Let's get this done.

309
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,360
- Dad, you know--
- No,

310
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,910
we don't need any help, Mitchell.
Just pick up your end.

311
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,070
- Dad, stop, stop, stop.
- What? A break already?

312
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,920
Dad, you're obviously
going through something.

313
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,960
Look, you do not have
to go through this alone.

314
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,260
I'm here to talk if you want.

315
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,720
That's really nice of you, Mitchell,

316
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,330
but do you wanna do it here?

317
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,230
'Cause I saw a little princess
table with a tea set on it.

318
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,550
You and I could have
a real gab fest.

319
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,590
I'm such a blockhead.

320
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,240
Can't we just get
this into the car?

321
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,790
Why? So you're not late
for your shrink session?

322
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,680
- What?
- Yeah. I picked up on that.

323
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,860
Bunny hugger!

324
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,120
Saw that, too.

325
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,550
Mobile spinner.

326
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,650
I swear to God...

327
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,790
What are you doing back here?!

328
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,420
I didn't have the room key, and
I don't want to be seen in public.

329
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,580
I thought about
what you said before...

330
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,710
When did China's last emperor
ascend the throne?

331
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,690
1909.

332
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,530
And you can say a lot
of things about me,

333
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
but I am not someone
who lives through her kids.

334
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,050
Sorry. It's 1909.

335
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,370
Do I like to see you succeed?
Of course I do!

336
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,820
- Tritium is an isotope of what element?
- Hydrogen.

337
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,160
But do I need that to make
myself feel important?

338
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:44,570
Absolutely not.

339
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,440
No, the answer is hydrogen.

340
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,150
As a matter of fact, I'm a little hurt
you would think I was so shallow.

341
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,090
The persian satrapy of Skudra
included which two areas?

342
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,720
Macedonia and Thrace.

343
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,930
I know moms like that,
and that is not me.

344
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,330
No way.

345
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,560
Macedonia and Thrace.

346
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,220
Are you freaking kidding me?!

347
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,330
Macedonia and Thrace?
What even is that?!

348
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,680
You're hardly even listening!

349
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,920
How could we lose this?!

350
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,550
- I said "we."
- Yeah. You do that sometimes.

351
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,650
I'm so sorry.

352
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,890
I am one of those moms.

353
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,020
I like it too much when you win.

354
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,750
I really love lording it
over the other moms.

355
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,640
Well, in our house, I'm kind
of your only source for that.

356
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,330
You're telling me.

357
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,150
Haley e-mails me
pictures of her nails.

358
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,460
And Luke asked me if he's part owl.

359
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,560
He does get his head
pretty far around.

360
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,660
Alex, I'm so sorry.

361
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,310
It's okay.

362
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,540
Maybe you do put pressure on me,

363
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:42,180
but it's nothing compared
to what I put on myself.

364
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,830
I guess I needed somebody
to blame for what happened today,

365
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,500
and there you were.

366
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,980
You know I'm in awe of you, right?

367
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,460
Come on. I know a back way
out of this place.

368
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,000
Wait. Don't you have to return that?

369
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,870
No way. I paid good money for this.

370
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,110
- We're taking it down the waterslide.
- Okay.

371
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,760
How can she not be here, either?

372
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,770
This is hopeless.

373
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,410
Have a little faith.

374
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,900
Did the Jews give up 
when the Egyptians

375
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,840
chased them to the banks
of the red sea?

376
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,230
How do you know all this stuff?

377
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,970
Was I the only one listening
to Uncle Menachem's toast?

378
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,960
Well, I'm glad it worked out
for the ancient Jews,

379
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,480
but at the moment I don't
see God doing me any...

380
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,020
Look!

381
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,700
I'm not gonna embarrass you,

382
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,950
but you got one minute
to get out of here.

383
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,130
You, too.

384
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:32,430
It's for the best.

385
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,110
All this sneaking around
was kind of weighing on me.

386
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,790
Let's just grab
our gift bags and go.

387
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,800
No. I still have 50 seconds.

388
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,560
Excuse me.

389
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,140
My name is Manny Delgado,
and I've been searching for you

390
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,930
since you smiled at me
in the lobby today,

391
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,840
maybe even my whole life.

392
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,230
It's too late for us to have
the magical night I was hoping for,

393
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,880
but it's not too late
for us to have a memento

394
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,230
of what might have been.

395
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:57,690
I'll be waiting.

396
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,950
- Okay, Mitch.
- Too late. Not interested.

397
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,320
Now listen.

398
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,200
Okay, you know what?
I'm just gonna go out the back.

399
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,600
Door, sunroof, all on lockdown.

400
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,860
Okay, look, that guy you met today

401
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,980
he is a shrink.

402
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,130
But I don't see him all the time.

403
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,210
You mom and I saw him
a little before the divorce.

404
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,590
But every now and then,
something comes up for me,

405
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,020
and I go in for a tune-up.

406
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,160
If you're waiting for me to ask
what's going on with you,

407
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,890
you just better keep waiting, 'cause

408
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,350
I learned my lesson.

409
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:44,250
I'm down about something.
Something I knew was coming,

410
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,630
and now it's finally happening.

411
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,670
We're turning my office
into the nursery today.

412
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,090
You've been moping around like
you lost your platoon over a room?

413
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,920
Not just a room.

414
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,100
It's the only place in this house

415
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:00,300
where I can still close the door

416
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,210
and read a book or have a drink.

417
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,090
Everything in there was mine.

418
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,770
Who cares? Everybody's
got their problems.

419
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,080
No.

420
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,680
You know, I can still open my door.

421
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,880
You just locked yourself back in.

422
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,650
Look, dad, I...

423
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,570
I had to give up my home office
for Lily's bedroom,

424
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,870
and I was upset about it, too.

425
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,240
- Snwa't hugging bunnies, but...
- All right.

426
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:28,820
I- I realize that it wasn't
about an office or a room.

427
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,630
It was about how Lily
was gonna change everything.

428
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,800
But once we got her
in there, I don't know.

429
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,230
I-I just- I never looked back.

430
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,150
Yeah, I guess I'm just nervous
about everything, you know.

431
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,750
Thanks, kid.

432
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
You know, I'm just recalling
me grumbling about

433
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,400
giving up my mg roadster
when you and Claire came along.

434
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,980
Great car.

435
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,560
No backseat.

436
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,410
Isn't it funny? The stupid
things that we think...

437
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:57,580
She was my baby.

438
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,530
...are so important.

439
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,760
I guess all told,
we had about 50 chickens.

440
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,120
Maybe 115 head of hogs.

441
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,390
Let's see, 55 cattle.

442
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,370
You know what'll be fun?

443
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,910
Let's see if I can remember
all their names.

444
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:11,780
There was... Albert,
Lisa, Steph, and Mike

445
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,240
Gloria! No, Gloria! Gloria!

446
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,310
No. I do not want
to hear one more story.

447
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,820
I am going to take a nap now.

448
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,310
Okay, yeah, sure. 
Whatever you want.

449
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,870
This day's about you.

450
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,630
- Just one more thing
- No, no one more thing!

451
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,200
I just wanted to take
a picture, you know,

452
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:27,520
to commemorate our special day.

453
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,460
Okay, fine! Take the picture!

454
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,280
No, not here. The lighting's terrible.

455
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,720
I was thinking we could take it...
in your new nursery!

456
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,730
No, Cam. No.

457
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,920
But, Gloria, come.

458
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,000
Somebody has to tell you this. No.

459
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,530
You try to control everything.

460
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,480
You take over people's lives!

461
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,390
It's always too much with you!

462
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,770
You know, maybe we should talk
about this out in the hallway.

463
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,950
Why, because there's gonna be
better lighting over there?

464
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,170
You're doing it again, Cam.

465
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,800
You're doing it again!

466
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,470
You're right.
I am too much.

467
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,350
I do control. I do barge.

468
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,050
I'll have my friend Abelard
come back and paint over it.

469
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,290
So this is why you
kept me outside all day?

470
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,140
So that your friend Aburar
could come and paint a present?

471
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,180
Yeah, rather than getting you a gift
off your registry like a normal person.

472
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,720
- I'm so stupid.
- I love it!

473
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,730
You do?

474
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,430
It's just like you, full of color...

475
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,890
And life... and love.

476
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,390
I really did think you'd love it.

477
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,280
What's going on up here?

478
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,710
What the...

479
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,590
Okay, that was not my idea.
I told Cam-

480
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,530
I told him that's a lot
to put on someone's wall.

481
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,030
Hold on.

482
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,950
- I like it.
- Really?

483
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,640
- Thanks, Cam.
- You actually...

484
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,990
Makes it easier
to give up the room.

485
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,960
That's close.

486
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,680
Guy was an inch out of bounds.

487
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,120
Time-out.

488
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,750
You know what?

489
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,290
I'm not gonna be able to relax
until I get this out of the way.

490
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,040
Dishwasher.

491
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,540
Pretty cool, huh?

492
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,980
Yeah. It is.

493
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,810
Do you think...

494
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,380
- Mind if I freshen this?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Allow me.

495
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,620
Your hand's shaking.

496
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,290
Remember, Dave, it's just a game.

497
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,540
- Oh, God! Oh, my God!
- My gosh.

498
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,550
- Come here.
- It's all right.

499
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,150
- I'm- I'm just a little wet.
- No, you're drenched.

500
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,140
You can't sit in that. 
You know what?

501
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,800
Take that off.
I'll throw 'em both in the dryer

502
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,110
and get us a couple of clean ones.

503
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,210
- Okay.
- Yeah.

504
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,930
Well, I guess this is
something we're doing.

505
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,860
Interception!

506
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,190
Interception!

507
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,350
- Come on, buddy!
- Come on!

508
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,680
- Come on!
- Come on, buddy!

509
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,840
- Touchdown!
- Yeah!

510
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,410
How exciting is this?!

511
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,520
It's been so long.

512
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:02,190
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

513
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,340
My car keys.

514
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,780
Shoot. The TV went off.

515
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,670
Must have screwed something up.

516
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,040
You know what? It doesn't matter.
There's another one upstairs.

517
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,730
How about we head up to the bedroom
for some halftime festivities?

518
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,360
- Okay.
- Let's do this.

519
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,360
I'd forgotten how much fun
this can be.

520
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,220
We should make this
a regular thing.

521
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,240
Phil, Phil, wait.

522
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,210
- I think I'd better just head home.
- What?

523
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,510
I'm just coming out of
a long-term relationship,

524
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,600
and I guess 
I'm still pretty fragile.

525
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,680
It's not that I haven't had
a- a great time.

526
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:38,840
Not at all. I get it.

527
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,330
I've spent a few nights
in heartbreak hotel.

528
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,340
If there's anything I can do...

529
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,750
You've already done 
more than you know.
