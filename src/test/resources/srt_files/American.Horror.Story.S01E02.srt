Hey, Maria.

11
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,554
You want to come see
The Doors with us?

12
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:49,567
I can't.

13
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:51,063
I have an anatomy
test tomorrow.

14
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,798
Oh, Maria.

15
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:54,800
You're such a square.

16
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:55,868
Can't you girls
leave her alone?

17
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:57,203
What did she ever do to you?

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,738
She refused to
pray for my sins.

19
00:00:58,806 --> 00:01:00,206
I hope you get the clap.

20
00:01:00,274 --> 00:01:03,234
Right, guess you lezzies
don't have to worry about that.

21
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:11,561
Your heart's in
the right place,

22
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:12,729
it's your head
I'm worried about.

23
00:01:17,603 --> 00:01:18,973
You forget your diaphragm?

24
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:23,510
You can still get the clap
with a diaphragm.

25
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:25,012
Maria!

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,483
Those bitches.

27
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:30,217
Don't answer it.

28
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,459
Excuse me, ma'am.

29
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:40,262
I don't want to bother you, but
I'm hurt and needing some help.

30
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,167
This might sting a little.

31
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:48,938
Hello, Les.

32
00:01:49,006 --> 00:01:51,140
Were you expecting me?

33
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:53,109
Saw you down on the sidewalk.

34
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:56,413
Seemed to be a very
interesting encounter.

35
00:01:56,481 --> 00:02:01,019
You think that Jesus
is going to save you?

36
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,020
I'm already saved.

37
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:03,021
Hmm.

38
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:03,922
We all are.

39
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,162
I can't find the source
of the bleeding.

40
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,530
There's no...

41
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,200
no wound.

42
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,405
Don't get smart!

43
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:21,074
It'll only make it worse.

44
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:30,117
Fatty Patty, Fatty Patty.

45
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,519
I didn't come here to discuss Ed Carson.

46
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:33,887
Yes, I gathered that.

47
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:36,424
Our Mr. Carson is...

48
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:38,026
I imagine you did it with

49
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:40,295
your usual subtlety and tact.

50
00:02:40,363 --> 00:02:42,865
You are a little heavy-handed
at that sort of thing, you know.

51
00:02:42,932 --> 00:02:44,300
It's the intention that counts.

52
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:46,236
I assure you,
my interest is quite genuine.

53
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:48,405
Oh, now, that's surprising, Les.

54
00:02:48,472 --> 00:02:49,839
From all the hints I've heard

55
00:02:49,907 --> 00:02:51,074
dropped over town
all these years...

56
00:02:51,142 --> 00:02:52,242
Wake up, sugar.

57
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,249
Put it on.

58
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:02,788
Do it.

59
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,034
No, not over your clothes.

60
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:17,702
Take them off.

61
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:30,680
Please.

62
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:31,882
I'm a virgin.

63
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:41,793
Strip.

64
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,525
Well, there are
no hard and set rules, Les.

65
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:12,994
He's a very sick man.

66
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,094
Well, you'll let me know

67
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:15,462
what I can do to help him.

68
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,199
I told you...

69
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,601
Jesus can't save me.

70
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:27,175
My Lord God,
even now I accept at thy hands

71
00:04:27,243 --> 00:04:30,812
cheerfully and willingly,
with all its anxieties,

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,413
pains and sufferings,

73
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,383
whatever death it shall
please thee to be mine.

74
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,651
Amen.

75
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:40,822
My Lord God,
even now I accept at thy hands

76
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,525
cheerfully and willingly,

77
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:48,162
with all of
its anxieties, pains

78
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,230
and sufferings,

79
00:04:50,298 --> 00:04:53,100
whatever death it shall
please thee to be mine.

80
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,003
Amen.

81
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,353
You can't break a man like Rossi.

82
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,054
He's not done.

83
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:13,322
You're outmatched.

84
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,190
If you did get him,
he might break you.

85
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,693
Did that ever occur to you?

86
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,261
You better make up
your mind, Laura.

87
00:05:19,328 --> 00:05:21,696
I'm giving you
some brotherly advice.

88
00:05:21,764 --> 00:05:23,231
Concede gracefully.

89
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,462
Sorry.

90
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:59,602
So, what do shrinks think about
when a wildly brilliant patient

91
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:02,805
doesn't talk
to punish said psychiatrist?

92
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:04,307
I bet you think about sex.

93
00:06:04,374 --> 00:06:06,208
Do you think about sex a lot?

94
00:06:06,276 --> 00:06:08,143
I think about
one girl in particular.

95
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:10,278
Your daughter.

96
00:06:10,346 --> 00:06:12,581
I jerk off thinking
about her. A lot.

97
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:15,150
I'm not comfortable with you
talking about my daughter, Tate.

98
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:17,686
Don't you want to know
what I do to her?

99
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:21,758
<i>How I lay her on the bed</i>
<i>and I caress her soft skin,</i>

100
00:06:21,826 --> 00:06:24,327
<i>make her purr</i>
<i>like a little kitten.</i>

101
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:25,662
She's a virgin.

102
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,833
<i>They get wet so easily.</i>

103
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:32,269
Do you turn to these thoughts

104
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:35,105
to comfort yourself
in times of stress?

105
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:36,740
Actually, yes.

106
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,976
I jerk off a lot to make
the visions to go away.

107
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,512
Blood and the carnage.

108
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,248
I want the thoughts to go away,
and you're not helping me.

109
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:47,785
Well, we've only been working
together a few weeks now.

110
00:06:47,852 --> 00:06:51,422
Well, you're sexual, right?

111
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,523
Violet told me about the affair

112
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:54,858
with the girl in Boston.

113
00:06:54,926 --> 00:06:56,427
Not much older
than her, she said.

114
00:06:56,494 --> 00:06:58,762
Our time is up.
Bullshit. I don't accept that.

115
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,773
Our time is up for today, Tate.

116
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:18,982
I thought we had an agreement.

117
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,317
Do I have to get
this number changed?

118
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:22,038
I'm pregnant.

119

<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

120
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:41,791
I thought you hated smoking.

121
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,401
I've taken it up.

122
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:45,068
I can't sleep.

123
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,805
I'm terrified of everything.

124
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:52,041
What attacked me wasn't human.

125
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:52,870
It was Tate.

126
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,271
No, you saw
that other thing, too.

127
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:55,905
He was trying to
freak us both out.

128
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:58,914
What'd you tell your parents?

129
00:08:58,981 --> 00:09:02,050
Don't worry.

130
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:04,575
I told them I got attacked
by some chola on Melrose

131
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:05,918
who wanted my Chanel.

132
00:09:06,326 --> 00:09:08,732
Couldn't tell them I went
to your house to score coke, could I?

133
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:10,661
I had to file a fake
police report and everything.

134
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:11,886
How deep are the cuts?

135
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:15,333
Deep.

136
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:19,261
God, and I-I can't stop
thinking about that mouth.

137
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:20,279
It was a mask.

138
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:23,244
He was purposely trying
to terrorize you.

139
00:09:25,196 --> 00:09:27,231
That hat doesn't look like you.

140
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:28,632
It serves a purpose.

141
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:31,968
Look.

142
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:33,335
My hair is turning white

143
00:09:33,403 --> 00:09:34,240
from fear.

144
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,205
Yeah, I read on the Internet
that's possible.

145
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:43,445
Do you believe in the devil?

146
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:46,581
No.

147
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:48,883
I do.

148
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:51,786
I've looked into his eyes.

149
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:26,256
Check Violet!

150
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,313
Did someone break in?

151
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,080
Go back upstairs.

152
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,949
I'm calling the police.

153
00:11:26,454 --> 00:11:27,821
Go home, Addy.

154
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,159
Come on.

155
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,776
The police are on their way.

156
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:51,711
Tell them to forget it--
it was only Addy.

157
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,713
I'm gonna have someone come out

158
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:56,149
and check all
the windows and doors, though.

159
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:57,918
If that little freak
can get in, anyone can.

160
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,219
You shouldn't call her that!

161
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:01,254
Are you okay?
You're shaking.

162
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,365
I haven't thrown up, Ben.

163
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,600
When I was pregnant with Violet,

164
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,669
I was sick all the time
for two months straight.

165
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,840
There's something wrong
with this baby, I can feel it.

166
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:25,208
I'd be worried if you
didn't think something was wrong

167
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,710
after what you went through,
with your last pregnancy.

168
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,679
Your anxiety level must
be through the roof.

169
00:12:29,747 --> 00:12:31,147
Don't shrink me.

170
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:37,720
You know what I feel?

171
00:12:37,787 --> 00:12:39,855
This baby...

172
00:12:39,923 --> 00:12:43,159
is why we moved here.

173
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:45,227
It's our salvation, Viv.

174
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:58,652
<i>I'm pulling</i>

175
00:12:58,772 --> 00:13:00,577
and pulling, and this
Karen Carpenter

176
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:03,999
"isn't life the shit"
elevator music keeps playing.

Chopped in half,
like a freaking Ginsu.

185
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:32,275
I'm feeling around like,

186
00:13:32,343 --> 00:13:34,878
"What the hell,
where's my legs, man?"

187
00:13:34,945 --> 00:13:35,779
Sounds terrifying.

188
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,449
How many times
have you had this dream?

189
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:39,584
Like, ten.

190
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:42,186
I mean, not a lot freaks me out,

191
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,655
but this shit's serious.

192
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,991
Like, if I'm with some dude
and he touches my belly,

193
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,060
I get all squirrelly.

194
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,295
Is it weird living
in Murder House?

195
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,499
Excuse me?

196
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,302
What do you mean, the-the
crime that took place here?

197
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,304
Were you aware of that
before you came to see me?

198
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,773
Dude, you're on
the Murder House tour.

199
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,311
I see. I had assumed
you found me

200
00:14:07,378 --> 00:14:09,646
through the Screen Actors Guild
insurance list.

201
00:14:09,714 --> 00:14:10,947
Yeah, yeah, totally.

202
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:12,748
Then I got here, and
I couldn't believe it.

203
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,149
I almost didn't ring the bell.

204
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:16,685
But then I thought,
"This must be my lucky day."

205
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,754
So, your career,

206
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:20,155
how's that going?

207
00:14:20,223 --> 00:14:21,556
Kind of slow.

208
00:14:21,624 --> 00:14:22,925
Did the murder happen in here?

209
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,493
I don't know, Bianca.

210
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,761
I'm more interested
in your nightmare.

211
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,632
Have you ever suffered
from any sexual abuse?

212
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:32,167
Like molested?

213
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:34,669
No.

214
00:14:34,737 --> 00:14:36,704
Sounds to me like your
dream is an expression

215
00:14:36,772 --> 00:14:38,039
of some emotional pain
you're repressing.

216
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:40,074
Part of you feels...

217
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:42,476
separate, shut down.

218
00:14:42,544 --> 00:14:45,346
You're reaching for it like you
reached for your missing legs,

219
00:14:45,413 --> 00:14:48,782
but... all you find
is a bloody stump.

220
00:14:50,918 --> 00:14:53,820
What do you think might be
shut down in you, Bianca?

221
00:14:53,887 --> 00:14:55,288
I don't know.

222
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:59,292
I think I'm just afraid
of being cut in half.

223
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,364
Hello, Mrs. Langdon?

224
00:15:05,432 --> 00:15:08,000
It's Ben Harmon,
Tate's therapist.

225
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:09,268
Mrs. Langdon, I'm calling

226
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:10,903
because I can't treat
your son anymore.

227
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,338
I'd like to give you the number
of another psychiatrist

228
00:15:13,406 --> 00:15:15,640
who I think could help him.

229
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,843
Because your son has crossed
a line with my daughter.

230
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,312
That's so weird.

231
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,081
I thought you had left.

232
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:25,816
I got turned around.

233
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:29,521
How many rooms in this house?

234
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:30,655
Uh, excuse me,

235
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:32,724
uh, one second, Mrs. Langdon.

236
00:15:32,792 --> 00:15:33,859
That's why I prefer

237
00:15:33,926 --> 00:15:35,560
my patients
to use the front door.

238
00:15:35,628 --> 00:15:36,795
I'm so tweaked out.

239
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:38,230
It's gonna get easier, Bianca.

240
00:15:38,298 --> 00:15:40,533
Staring down your fears,
facing them head-on,

241
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,735
is the best thing you can do.

242
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:44,170
You were brave today.

243
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:45,772
Cool.

244
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,508
I got it.
Mm.

245
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,010
I'm so sorry.

246
00:15:50,077 --> 00:15:52,745
I mean, l-look,
they're teenagers.

247
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:55,047
I understand your concern.

248
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:59,584
I'm just not comfortable
continuing treatment in my home.

249
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:14,667
How come I don't
look like these girls?

250
00:16:14,735 --> 00:16:15,835
'Cause you don't.

251
00:16:15,903 --> 00:16:17,570
That's just
the way you were born.

252
00:16:17,638 --> 00:16:18,738
Accept it.

253
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:21,074
You were hatched
with other gifts.

254
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:22,275
Like what?

255
00:16:22,343 --> 00:16:23,610
Oh, Christ on a stick,

256
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,379
I don't know, finger-painting.

257
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:28,181
Get me that ipecac syrup

258
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:29,482
out of the cupboard
there, honey.

259
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,350
In the brown jar.

260
00:16:31,452 --> 00:16:32,619
Thanks, baby.

261
00:16:32,686 --> 00:16:35,355
Does this make the
cupcakes taste good?

262
00:16:35,423 --> 00:16:37,123
You can't actually taste it, no.

263
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:38,658
It's, uh...

264
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:41,260
it causes violent
stomach upset,

265
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:45,063
and sometimes internal bleeding.

266
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:46,932
Okay.

267
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:48,988
Spit in it.

00:17:16,363 --> 00:17:17,864
What do you want?

272
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:19,565
Well...

273
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,567
more than anything, I guess,

274
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:23,502
to be on the stage.

275
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:26,138
You know what stopped me?

276
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:27,439
Fear...

277
00:17:27,507 --> 00:17:29,107
of what my family would say.

278
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:32,478
But... now that they're,
well, you know,

279
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:35,714
dead, and, uh, I have
terminal brain cancer,

280
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:39,551
I figure... maybe I should
just go for it, you know?

281
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:41,053
Chase that dream.

282
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,787
What about you?

What dream are you chasing?

284
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:45,323
Or should I say,

285
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,325
what dream is chasing you?

286
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:48,659
Leave me alone.

287
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:49,894
It's the house, isn't it?
Wrong.

288
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:50,995
Whatever's tearing you apart,

289
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:52,130
the house already
knows about it.

290
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:53,231
It'll use it against you.

291
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:55,000
Jesus, this is
not about the house!

292
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,668
This is about me!

293
00:17:56,736 --> 00:17:57,569
What I did!

294
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,806
I cheated on my wife!

I'm trying very hard
not to judge you.

298
00:18:07,113 --> 00:18:09,882
Me? You murdered
your entire family.

299
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:11,784
Yes.

300
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:13,753
But I was never unfaithful.

301
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:18,491
Guess who called me today.

302
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,293
You don't have a choice.

303
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,095
You're gonna have to do the honorable thing
to save your family.

304
00:18:23,163 --> 00:18:24,664
You're gonna have to lie.

The heavyset gal I treated
two summers ago.

307
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:35,174
She tried to commit suicide.

308
00:18:35,242 --> 00:18:36,876
In the hospital.

309
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:38,578
Won't talk to anybody.

310
00:18:38,645 --> 00:18:41,047
Her parents are begging me

311
00:18:41,114 --> 00:18:42,381
to go out there.

312
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:43,482
All the way to Boston?

313
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,817
Just for a day or two.

314
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,452
You know what you
are, Ben Harmon?

315
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,686
An idiot.

316
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:50,156
You're a good man.

317
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,334
Avon calling.

318
00:19:03,402 --> 00:19:05,570
Oh, Constance,

319
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:08,640
now's not a good time.
I just wanted to bring these by

320
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,878
as a little peace offering for Addy
disturbing your slumber.

321
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:14,714
Thank you.
I think I'm gonna have

322
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,816
to start strapping her
in at night again.

323
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:19,052
Um... well,
I appreciate it.

324
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,588
I'm not usually much of
a cupcake girl myself, but...

325
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:23,824
They're not for <i>you!</i>

326
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:25,091
At your age?

327
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:26,593
You might as well just

328
00:19:26,661 --> 00:19:28,929
Krazy Glue a stick
of butter to your ass.

329
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,164
These are for Violet.

00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:32,066
Oh, I see your
little flowers there.

331
00:19:32,133 --> 00:19:33,500
Candied violets.

332
00:19:33,568 --> 00:19:36,370
They're from a wonderful
Mexican market

333
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,104
on Alvarado Street.

334
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:40,473
I'll give you the name--
just don't go after sundown.

335
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,542
Okay. Thank you.

336
00:19:46,512 --> 00:19:47,679
What?

337
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:49,749
You're with child.

338
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:53,286
I have the nose
of a truffle pig.

339
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:55,556
I could smell that little angel

340
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:58,259
the second I walked
in the door.

341
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,293
Pheromones.

342
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:00,795
Wow.

343
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:02,130
So, uh,

344
00:20:02,198 --> 00:20:03,599
is Violet home?

345
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:05,868
I'd like to hand these
to her personally.

346
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:07,904
I'm a sucker for penance.

347
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:10,105
No, she's-she's not here.

348
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:11,340
I'll come back.

349
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:12,741
Constance?

350
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:16,445
I know this is a crazy question,

351
00:20:16,513 --> 00:20:19,048
but do you smell anything else
about the baby?

352
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:21,583
Two sugars and a great
deal of half and half.

353
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:24,453
Are you worried about something

354
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:26,522
in particular?

355
00:20:26,589 --> 00:20:29,525
I told you, those are for Violet.
She's not gonna eat both.

356
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:30,793
We can split it.

357
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:32,595
Mmm...

358
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,630
Mmm...

359
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:35,932
Can I ask you
a personal question?

360
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:37,834
If you had known

361
00:20:37,902 --> 00:20:40,303
about Addy before
she was born...

362
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,438
would you have done something?

363
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,107
When I first met you, you said

364
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,709
that if they'd had
the tests back then

365
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,144
that you might have...

366
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,012
Oh, don't think I
didn't think about it,

367
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,049
even after she was born, leaving
that little bug-eye out in the cold.

368
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,218
That's what they do in China.

369
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,486
But a mother...

370
00:20:56,554 --> 00:20:59,255
never turns her back
on her child.

371
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:00,690
Every one of mine

372
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:01,958
was pure love.

373
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:05,161
You have other kids?
I have four.

374
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:07,563
I should've stopped
after the first.

375
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:11,200
My womb is cursed.

376
00:21:11,268 --> 00:21:12,536
My husband

377
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:13,837
was the spitting image

378
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:15,005
of Van Johnson.

379
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,975
You'd think we'd make little...

380
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,844
cherub children,

381
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,781
fat and lively, but
it wasn't meant to be.

382
00:21:22,848 --> 00:21:25,384
I think...

383
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,453
our beauty...

384
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,755
was an affront to the gods.

385
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:32,191
All four of them had Downs?

386
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,525
Or some such malady.

387
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:36,061
Except for one.

388
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,995
He was a model of
physical perfection.

389
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,499
He was my gift.

390
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,768
But I lost him to other things.

391
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:48,238
Your baby's fine.

392
00:21:48,306 --> 00:21:49,739
Enough sad talk.

393
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:52,009
I'm off.

394
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,311
What are we gonna do
about Addy, Constance?

395
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:55,879
Well...

396
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,381
Oh, cupcake.
Not for you.

397
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:01,285
Moira, darling.

398
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,154
Put these away somewhere

399
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:06,124
until little Violet
can have them.

400
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,760
The Harmons here
are offending my largess.

401
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,763
And don't forget the
crumbs on the table.

402
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,565
Moira and I go way back.

403
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,133
Isn't that right?

404
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:19,238
Why, I even employed
her for a time.

405
00:22:19,306 --> 00:22:22,509
I hope her dusting
has improved.

406
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:27,881
Your sense of humor was,
and continues to be, a delight.

407
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:33,053
Is there anything more wonderful
than the promise of a new child?

408
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:35,288
Or more heartbreaking

409
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:37,323
when that promise is broken?

410
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,030
I'll bring this to the car.

411
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,434
Thank you.

412
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:53,774
Is everybody crazy?

413
00:23:01,117 --> 00:23:03,485
I wish you could come with me.

414
00:23:03,553 --> 00:23:04,720
Yeah, me, too.

415
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,444
I turned it down.
What do you want?

416
00:23:22,512 --> 00:23:23,512
Can I come in?

417
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:27,783
Hi.

418
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:29,752
Our kooky neighbor
made you cupcakes.

419
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:31,353
Huh. A candied violet.

420
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:32,521
That's clever.

421
00:23:34,824 --> 00:23:37,692
Want to watch a movie? I figured
since your dad's gone tonight,

422
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,327
we could have
a little girl's night.

423
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:41,330
Yeah. No, thanks.

424
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:43,599
Thought it might be fun to hang out.
Can't. Homework.

425
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,067
Are you mad at me
about something?

426
00:23:47,304 --> 00:23:49,772
Why don't you eat it
since you're eating for two now?

427
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,541
What, you think I'm stupid?

428
00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:54,043
You stopped drinking
wine at dinner,

429
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,544
and you're gaining
weight in your face.

430
00:23:58,248 --> 00:24:00,315
I was gonna tell you tonight.

431
00:24:00,383 --> 00:24:03,118
You know the statistics,
when you have a baby over 40.

432
00:24:03,186 --> 00:24:04,853
Yeah, I do.

433
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,590
You want to talk about it?

434
00:24:08,658 --> 00:24:11,127
No, thanks. I'm good.

435
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:20,770
Having a baby isn't going

436
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:22,172
to keep you and Dad together,

437
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,373
if that's what you're thinking.

438
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:24,708
Wow, Violet.

439
00:24:24,776 --> 00:24:26,877
I am really appreciating
your optimism on this.

440
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:28,379
Really am.

441
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:30,180
Come on, go ahead
and say all your mean things.

442
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:32,883
I think you're weak.

443
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,753
Okay.

444
00:25:09,756 --> 00:25:11,756
Thank you, Ben.

445
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:12,924
All right.

446
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:14,259
Just till it's over.

447
00:25:14,327 --> 00:25:15,593
I understand.

448
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:17,161
It's the least I can do.

449
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:20,532
We are on a desert island.

450
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:26,272
I'm over us, you know?

451
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:28,307
I mean, what's it say about me?

452
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,977
Sleeping with a married guy,
my teacher?

453
00:25:31,045 --> 00:25:33,513
Could I be more textbook?

454
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:35,115
It's not who I want
to be anymore.

455
00:25:36,918 --> 00:25:39,220
I just need
your support right now.

456
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,655
You got it.

457
00:25:40,723 --> 00:25:43,458
When I imagine lying there

458
00:25:43,526 --> 00:25:45,995
on that table tomorrow morning,

459
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:47,630
it's just so sad.

460
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:50,766
Our baby.

461
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:53,469
Wasn't meant to be.

462
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:59,607
To you, Hayden, for
handling this with

463
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:01,708
grace and maturity.

464
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:11,750
Um, listen, to, uh,
be clear, I'm gonna...

465
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:13,753
I'm gonna sleep on
the couch tonight.

466
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:17,391
I just need you till it's over.

467
00:26:17,458 --> 00:26:19,159
Then you go back
to Saint Vivien,

468
00:26:19,227 --> 00:26:25,166
and I go back to <i>Personality</i>
<i>Theory and Psychopathology.</i>

469
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,735
Not so bad.

470
00:26:28,571 --> 00:26:29,838
Pizza!

471
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:31,773
Yay!

472
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,315
Are you kidding me?
I-I just need to check this...

473
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:41,516
Sorry. Am I in a time warp?

474
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:43,351
Did I not just two seconds ago

475
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:44,920
hear you say no calls?

476
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:46,087
Give me your phone.

477
00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:48,423
Hayden, no.

478
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:51,393
Come on, come on, take
it easy, take it easy.

479
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:53,328
It's okay.

480
00:26:53,396 --> 00:26:55,832
All I ever wanted was
for you to love me.

481
00:26:55,899 --> 00:26:57,533
Look, look,
no-no more calls.

482
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:59,235
No more calls.

483
00:27:20,157 --> 00:27:22,092
You stay.

484
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,260
Who is it?

485
00:27:25,563 --> 00:27:28,331
Excuse me, ma'am.

486
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,333
I don't want to bother you,

487
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:31,901
but I'm hurt
and needing some help.

488
00:27:31,969 --> 00:27:32,902
What happened to you?

489
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,439
I'm hurt and needing some help.

490
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:37,608
Open the door.

491
00:27:37,675 --> 00:27:38,976
Well, you said that.

492
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:40,210
Can you tell me what happened?

493
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:41,611
How did you get hurt?

494
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,380
Can't you see the
blood on my face?

495
00:27:43,447 --> 00:27:44,714
He's out here.

496
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:47,117
Let me in.

497
00:27:47,184 --> 00:27:48,585
What kind of woman are you?

498
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:51,655
He's coming.
He's gonna stab me!

499
00:27:51,722 --> 00:27:54,090
I'm-I'm... I'm gonna get help.

500
00:27:54,158 --> 00:27:55,558
I'm calling 911.

501
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:21,284
Violet!

502
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:23,219
- Violet! Answer me!
- How am I supposed

503
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:24,720
to finish my homework
if you keep interrupting?

504
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:25,688
What's the matter?
Where's your phone?

505
00:28:25,756 --> 00:28:26,689
In my bag upstairs.

506
00:28:26,757 --> 00:28:28,124
Go, go, go, go, go get it.

507
00:28:28,192 --> 00:28:29,859
Dial 911.

508
00:28:29,927 --> 00:28:31,361
Who's that?
Just go into your room,

509
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:35,098
lock the door, don't come out
until I tell you... now!

510
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:45,775
Stop it!

511
00:28:45,843 --> 00:28:47,243
I am not letting you
inside this house!

512
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,714
I have called 911.

513
00:28:48,834 --> 00:28:50,680
The police are on their way!

514
00:29:01,662 --> 00:29:02,595
I have money.

515
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:04,531
Please just take anything.

516
00:29:04,598 --> 00:29:06,199
We're not here to rob you.

517
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:08,869
Masks off.

518
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,871
The transcript was very clear.

519
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:13,341
The nurses saw R. Franklin;
he had nothing to hide.

520
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,146
12 minutes.
Then the fun begins.

521
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,581
I have a surprise for you.

522
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:24,319
No way.

523
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,320
I got it on eBay.

524
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,855
Authenticated.

525
00:29:26,922 --> 00:29:28,622
It's the one he used
to bash Maria.

526
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,991
Let me see it.

527
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:32,593
Holy shit.

528
00:29:32,661 --> 00:29:35,595
Can feel the energy
in this. This is bitchin'.

529
00:29:35,663 --> 00:29:36,329
Who goes first?

530
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:39,165
Which one is Gladys?

531
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:46,206
Screw you, psycho!
I'm not putting this on.

532
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:49,009
You have to. Everything
has to be perfect.

533
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:50,311
Take your clothes off!
No!

534
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:52,113
Put it on me! Mom!

535
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:53,815
Oh, you'll both
be wearing uniforms.

536
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:56,051
R. Franklin hated nurses.

537
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:59,155
He had a bad experience with the
mercury in a broken thermometer.

538
00:29:59,222 --> 00:30:01,791
That's why he took
Gladys upstairs

539
00:30:01,858 --> 00:30:04,093
and drowned her in the tub.

540
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,998
And you, Maria--

541
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:10,566
he saved you for last.

542
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:13,303
R. Franklin was the first.
Before Manson.

543
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,771
He changed the culture.

544
00:30:14,838 --> 00:30:16,271
We're paying tribute to him.

545
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:20,575
We're not going to be part
of your reenactment.

546
00:30:20,643 --> 00:30:24,212
Put this on. You won't like
it if I have to make you.

547
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,533
Tate, they're trying
to kill me and my mom!

548
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,369
You have to get them to the basement.
What the hell are you talking about?

549
00:30:46,436 --> 00:30:47,870
The basement!
Just do it!

550
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:56,047
Some serious art, man.

551
00:30:56,114 --> 00:30:57,615
Why are you trying
to cover it up?

552
00:30:59,085 --> 00:31:01,052
Decided I didn't like it.

553
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:09,794
It's all over, Mama.

554
00:31:09,861 --> 00:31:11,328
Nobody's coming to help you.

555
00:31:11,396 --> 00:31:13,764
You don't have to, you know.
You could just stop it.

556
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:15,966
Oh, but I don't want to, silly.

557
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:19,302
Well, I don't think

558
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:21,337
you're gonna kill me tonight,

559
00:31:21,405 --> 00:31:26,408
'cause I think that someone
is going to stop this, and

560
00:31:26,476 --> 00:31:29,177
they're gonna get help,
and you all are gonna fry.

561
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,180
Brutal.

562
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,328
What's taking you so long?

563
00:31:46,396 --> 00:31:47,963
So, are these vintage?

564
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,264
Nurses' catalogue.

565
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:51,667
Really?

566
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,436
You're eating?

567
00:31:53,503 --> 00:31:56,706
It was, like, sitting there
saying, "Eat me."

568
00:31:56,773 --> 00:31:58,808
Step on it!
Time's a-wastin', sister.

569
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,976
Tell me what's going on
downstairs.

570
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,243
You got all the cell phones?

571
00:32:01,311 --> 00:32:03,412
Yeah, I... I told you.

572
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,713
The one in the kitchen and...

573
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:07,249
Ooh, stomachache.

574
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:08,717
Answer me! What's he
doing to my mother?

575
00:32:08,784 --> 00:32:11,119
Jesus, I'm gonna shit myself.

576
00:32:11,187 --> 00:32:12,654
Not in the staging area!

577
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,256
Just don't start without me.

578
00:32:17,927 --> 00:32:20,194
Are you kidding me?

579
00:32:20,262 --> 00:32:21,529
It's 10:57.

580
00:32:21,597 --> 00:32:23,230
Get in the tub.

581
00:32:24,499 --> 00:32:27,401
Bianca, it's almost time!

582
00:32:27,469 --> 00:32:29,503
You have to put someone
under water for three minutes

583
00:32:29,571 --> 00:32:31,306
until they lose consciousness.

584
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:33,241
The brain begins to die
from oxygen deprivation.

585
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,745
This is funny to you?

586
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:38,280
What's funny is how you think

587
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:39,916
you know everything
about this house,

588
00:32:39,983 --> 00:32:41,150
and clearly, you know nothing.

589
00:32:41,218 --> 00:32:42,051
This isn't even the right tub.

590
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,286
Second floor bathroom.

591
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:44,487
I used to study
the crime scene photos.

592
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:45,521
The one he used is
in the basement.

593
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,290
We totally remodeled
this bathroom.

594
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:48,858
You think I'm gonna fall
for that?

595
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,528
It's a grimy claw-foot tub
with a chrome faucet.

596
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,264
Go look.

597
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:57,836
Bianca?!

598
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:05,811
Can I ask you a question?

599
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:08,581
Is it pillow talk?

600
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:09,715
I don't know what that means.

601
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,484
No, of course you don't.

602
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,452
Do you think I could model?

603
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,855
I think

604
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:18,390
there isn't a closed door
in the world

605
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:20,593
that beauty can't open.

606
00:33:23,697 --> 00:33:25,764
You're beautiful, too, you know.

607
00:33:25,832 --> 00:33:26,899
Oh.

608
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:28,901
Dance with me.

609
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:31,003
There's no music.

610
00:33:32,306 --> 00:33:33,572
That's all right.

611
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,141
We'll make our own.

612
00:33:47,854 --> 00:33:48,854
I told you

613
00:33:48,922 --> 00:33:50,289
I was in a business meeting.

614
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:51,858
There's a bad man next door!

615
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:52,992
I know.
I don't like him, either,

616
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,827
but he owns the place,
and that's that.

617
00:33:54,895 --> 00:33:56,329
Now get out of here!

618
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:57,597
Go on! Get out of here!

619
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,233
It's nothing.

620
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:09,275
What?!
He's over there!

621
00:34:09,343 --> 00:34:10,877
Enough with the lies, Addy.

622
00:34:10,945 --> 00:34:12,379
You're a bad girl.
No!

623
00:34:12,447 --> 00:34:15,549
Yes. You don't behave,
you go in the bad girl closet.

624
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:17,318
Look at yourself!

625
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:21,689
Look long and hard.

626
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:51,516
This isn't right.

627
00:34:55,086 --> 00:34:57,087
You guys?

628
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:03,293
Fiona?

629
00:35:04,663 --> 00:35:07,364
I think I need to go
to the hospital.

630
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,736
Maybe we can come back
later and finish this.

631
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:14,672
Hey.

632
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,261
Where'd you guys go?

633
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:49,764
I hate these latches.

634
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:52,005
Too small for my fingers.

635
00:35:53,404 --> 00:35:54,507
Let me do it.

636
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:56,822
I got it.

637
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,790
Dress-up time.
Get up.

638
00:36:08,857 --> 00:36:11,393
Don't try anything.

639
00:36:13,062 --> 00:36:14,206
Could you turn around?

640
00:36:14,326 --> 00:36:16,932
No.
Then I will.

641
00:36:19,153 --> 00:36:20,904
Stupid-looking uniform.

642
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:24,307
I totally get why
he hated nurses.

643
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:41,992
I don't give a shit
how you're dressed!

644
00:36:56,606 --> 00:36:58,008
You'd better not be
messing with me.

645
00:36:58,128 --> 00:36:59,762
It's down here,
around the corner.

646
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,732
Where are you?!

647
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,501
Over here,
you stupid bitch.

648
00:37:10,107 --> 00:37:13,542
I've already filled it
with water for you.

649
00:37:37,165 --> 00:37:39,399
Violet!

650
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,744
Help! Somebody help us!

651
00:37:49,812 --> 00:37:53,081
Help! Somebody, help us!

652
00:37:53,149 --> 00:37:55,718
Call the police!
Help!

653
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:02,592
What the hell...?

654
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,861
Why aren't you dead?

655
00:38:04,928 --> 00:38:07,497
Fiona! The bitch is going
downstairs!

656
00:38:24,746 --> 00:38:26,848
I'm just gonna kill her, man;
this is bullshit!

657
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,117
Fiona?

658
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:52,708
I'm okay... really.

659
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:54,543
It's the right thing...
for both of us.

660
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:56,479
Hayden, I'm so sorry
about all this.

661
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:57,847
I wish I could fix it.

662
00:38:57,914 --> 00:38:59,515
I just wish you could come in
with me.

663
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,416
Hayden?

664
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:02,717
You ready?

665
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:06,822
I'll see you when I get out.

666
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:09,492
I'll be here.

667
00:39:34,751 --> 00:39:36,652
Jesus H. Christ.

668
00:39:38,021 --> 00:39:40,989
Was this your handiwork?

669
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:42,490
No.

670
00:39:42,558 --> 00:39:43,524
It was them.

671
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,261
We have to get rid
of the bodies...

672
00:39:47,329 --> 00:39:50,698
if you want him
to keep treating me.

673
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:53,401
I'll get the shovel,
you get the bleach.

674
00:39:57,439 --> 00:40:01,576
<i>So you were in Boston when this</i>
<i>all took place, Dr. Harmon?</i>

675
00:40:01,643 --> 00:40:03,411
Yes.
What was your business there?

676
00:40:03,479 --> 00:40:07,047
Uh, I was seeing a patient...

677
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,349
Ginny Blevens.

678
00:40:08,416 --> 00:40:09,917
A, uh... real patient?

679
00:40:11,653 --> 00:40:15,588
Unlike... her,
I mean?

680
00:40:15,656 --> 00:40:17,624
This is the female
you say you saw

681
00:40:17,692 --> 00:40:18,658
on Wednesday morning?

682
00:40:18,726 --> 00:40:19,792
Yes.

683
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,661
Yes, that's her.

684
00:40:21,728 --> 00:40:24,097
She must have been
casing the house.

685
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:27,700
I'd... I'd never
seen her before.

686
00:40:27,768 --> 00:40:29,269
And you won't see her again.

687
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:31,605
We found her six blocks from
here practically cut in half.

688
00:40:31,672 --> 00:40:35,208
Looks like maybe she couldn't go
through with it. Ran off.

689
00:40:35,276 --> 00:40:36,243
Her friends went after her,

690
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:38,178
tried to do
a Black Dahlia on her.

691
00:40:38,246 --> 00:40:39,446
Seems your attackers
were obsessed

692
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:40,681
with famous L.A. murders.

693
00:40:40,749 --> 00:40:42,216
Had a little club going.

694
00:40:42,284 --> 00:40:43,885
Planned to re-create
more than a few.

695
00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:46,154
We're still looking.
Don't worry.

696
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:49,524
Even in a town this big,
people don't just disappear.

697
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:51,826
I'm gonna check the
kitchen for more prints.

698
00:40:57,733 --> 00:41:00,867
Your mom said that you told her
that Tate helped you escape?

699
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:04,071
Yeah. Thanks for not
dragging him into all that.

700
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:06,774
What was he doing in the house?

701
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,275
How should I know?

702
00:41:08,343 --> 00:41:10,644
Violet...
You think I let him in?

703
00:41:10,712 --> 00:41:13,814
I don't know why Tate was here,
but I'm glad he was.

704
00:41:13,882 --> 00:41:15,616
You weren't.

705
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:24,358
You were really brave, Mom.

706
00:41:34,703 --> 00:41:36,538
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

707
00:41:36,605 --> 00:41:38,440
Me, too.

708
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:40,743
But you're here now.

709
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,045
That's right.

710
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:44,947
I'm home.

711
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:46,048
No, you're not.

712
00:41:51,233 --> 00:41:53,089
We're selling this house.

713
00:41:53,209 --> 00:41:59,841
