00:00:08,741 --> 00:00:12,341
A famous man once said:
"We create our own Demons".

3
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:17,770
Who said that? What does
that even mean? Doesn't matter.

4
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:18,995
I said it cause he said it.

5
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:22,497
So now he was famous and basically
getting said by two well known guys.

6
00:00:22,748 --> 00:00:25,749
I don't, uh...I'm gonna
start again.

7
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:30,077
Let's track this from the beginning.

8
00:01:07,507 --> 00:01:09,013
Half-hour 'till the
ball drops.

9
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:12,588
Tony Stark, great
speech man!

10
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:14,218
I gave a speech?

11
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:16,257
How was it?
- Edifying. - Unintelligible.

12
00:01:16,258 --> 00:01:18,493
Really? That's my favorite
kind, a winning combo.

13
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:20,083
- Hey, uh, where are we going?
- Uh, to town on each other,

14
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:22,137
probably back at your house.
I want to see your research.

15
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:23,732
Okay, you can see my
research, but that's...

16
00:01:24,134 --> 00:01:25,444
I'm not going to show
you my "town".

17
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:29,614
- Mr. Stark, Ho Yinsen.
- Oh, I finally met a man called Ho.

18
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:33,239
I'd like to introduce you to our
guest, Doctor Wu.

19
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,602
- Oh this guy.
- Mr. Stark.

20
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,022
Hey.

21
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:38,148
She's going to need a cardiologist
right away.

22
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:43,085
- Bye!
- Perhaps another time?

23
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:47,350
It started in Bern,
Switzerland, 1999.

24
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:50,870
The old days.

25
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,472
I never thought they'd come back to bite me.

26
00:01:56,211 --> 00:02:00,307
Hey Tony! Aldrich Killian,
I'm a big fan of your work.

27
00:02:00,507 --> 00:02:01,906
- My work?
- Who isn't? She needs me.

28
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:05,400
Well, of course, but Miss
Hansen my organization

29
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,177
has been tracking your research since
year two of MIT.

30
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,390
Oh wow, he made it.
He made the cut.

31
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:14,342
- What floor you going to, pal?
- Well now, that is an appropriate question.

32
00:02:14,428 --> 00:02:17,628
The ground floor, actually, of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

33
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:21,256
It's a privately-funded think tank called
"Advanced Idea Mechanics".

34
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:25,338
Uh, she'll take both. One to throw
away and one to not call.

35
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,770
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" or AIM
for short, you get it?

36
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,981
I see that 'cause it's on
your T-shirt.

37
00:02:31,006 --> 00:02:31,548
Oh!!

38
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:34,487
Ladies, follow the mullet.
Ladies first.

39
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,583
Thank you. I'll call you.

40
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,619
I am titillated by the notion
of working with you. - Yeah?

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,698
I'm going to ditch
these clowns.

42
00:02:42,723 --> 00:02:43,924
I'll see you up on the roof
in five minutes.

43
00:02:44,034 --> 00:02:46,886
I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick
if you know what I'm talkin' about.

44
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,131
I'll see you up there!

45
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,083
Damn betcha.

46
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:52,864
- Come on, I thought that was just a theory.
- Well... it was.

47
00:02:53,064 --> 00:02:55,519
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,768
that governs repair and chemically recode it.
- That's incredible.

49
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:02,611
Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic
operating system of a

50
00:03:02,612 --> 00:03:03,715
- living organism.
- Exactly.

51
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:08,934
Can you not touch my plant?
It's not... she doesn't like it. She perfers -

52
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:10,123
She's not like the others.

53
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,616
Come on, let's go to
the bedroom.

54
00:03:11,617 --> 00:03:13,827
Happy, leave her
ficus alone.

55
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,538
No, seriously, don't

56
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,209
- And you're starting with plants?
- For now, yes.

57
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,720
I'm calling it "Extremis".

58
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:23,062
- Well, its -
- Human application.

59
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,114
Exactly! Exactly!
Dentra-degree vitalization.

60
00:03:26,335 --> 00:03:27,956
Disease prevention.

61
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,189
Even limb regrowth.

62
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,639
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,729
- Wow!
- In Switzerland.

64
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,891
- That's better.
- This week.

65
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,342
You almost bought it,
didn't you?

66
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:53,920
This is what I'm talking
about, the glitch.

67
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:55,430
Have you checked the telomerase
algorithm?

68
00:03:58,503 --> 00:04:00,074
- We're good.
- Stay down.

69
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:02,274
You're right on me...

70
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:04,396
What the hell was that?

71
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:07,192
What the hell was that?

72
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:07,876
It's a glitch in my work.

73
00:04:08,277 --> 00:04:10,269
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

74
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,810
Oh, it's not Y2K...

75
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,366
Hey, Happy New
Year!

76
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:14,221
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

77
00:04:14,222 --> 00:04:16,363
Alright, I'll see you in the morning,
Okay? Good night.

78
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:16,715
You good?

79
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,224
- Yep. - I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

80
00:04:38,549 --> 00:04:44,090
So, why am I telling you this? Because I
had just created demons.

81
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,640
And I didn't even know it.

82
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:51,393
Yeah, those were good times.

83
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:53,545
Then I moved on.

84
00:04:54,356 --> 00:04:58,427
After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said "Goodbye" to the party scene.

85
00:04:58,527 --> 00:05:00,809
I forgot that night in Switzerland.

86
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,980
These days I'm a changed man.

87
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,842
I'm different now.

88
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:08,264
I'm... well, you know
who I am.

89
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:10,233
Sir, please may I request

90
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:13,056
just a few hours to calibrate -
- Nope!

91
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:18,899
Micro-repeater implanting
sequence complete!

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,726
As you wish, sir. I've
also prepared a

93
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:22,740
safety briefing for you
to enitrely ignore.

94
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:24,392
Which I will.

95
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:25,813
Alright, let's do this.

96
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:30,786
Dummy. Hi Dummy.
How did you get that cap on your head?

97
00:05:30,787 --> 00:05:31,896
You earned it.

98
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:33,222
Hey. Hey!

99
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:36,670
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

100
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,012
Blood on my mat, handle it.

101
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:43,234
Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours.

102
00:05:44,285 --> 00:05:46,396
Focus up ladies.
Good evening

103
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,207
And welcome to the
birthing suite.

104
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,953
I am pleased to announce the
imminent arrival

105
00:05:51,054 --> 00:05:53,821
of your bouncing,
badass baby brother.

106
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:57,075
Start titan and go white.
Stamp date and time.

107
00:05:58,095 --> 00:06:00,945
Mark 42 autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.

108
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:02,549
Initialize sequence.

109
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:06,847
Jarvis, drop my needle.

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,922
Crap.

111
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:52,404
Alright, I think we got this.
Send them all.

112
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,972
Probably just a little fast, slow it down.
Slow it down just a... little bit.

113
00:07:12,696 --> 00:07:14,558
Cool it, will you Jarvis?

114
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,082
Come on.

115
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,976
I ain't scared of you.

116
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,750
I'm the best.

117
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:46,946
As always sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.

118
00:07:46,977 --> 00:07:50,647
I guess 72 hours is a long
time between siestas.

119
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:53,719
Didn't think it could
get any worse.

120
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,252
Then they had to go and
turn on the TV.

121
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,964
That's when 'He' happened.

122
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:13,101
Some people call me a terrorist.

123
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:18,144
I consider myself a teacher.

124
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:22,667
America...

125
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:27,179
Ready for another lesson.

126
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,031
In 1864 in Sand Creek, Colorado.

127
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:35,083
The U.S. military waited until the friendly
Cheyenne Braves had all gone hunting.

128
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:39,336
Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind.

129
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,968
And claim their land.

130
00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:49,063
39 hours ago, the Ali Al Salem Air Base
in Kuwait was attacked.

131
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:52,124
I did that.

132
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,866
A quaint military church, filled with
wives and children of course.

133
00:08:58,347 --> 00:09:01,549
The soliders were out
on manuvers.

134
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,132
The "Braves" were away.

135
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:11,726
President Ellis, you continue to resist
my attempts to educate you, sir.

136
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,148
And now, you've missed
me again.

137
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:21,491
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.

138
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:25,774
And you'll never
see me coming.

139
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:31,487
... and now that we seem to be back,
let's recap some of the frightening developments in this story.

140
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:33,799
American airways
were hijacked.

141
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,320
The nation remains
on high alert.

142
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:37,890
All attempts to find the Mandarin have
so far proved unsuccessful.

143
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,914
Central to my administration's response to this
terrorist event is a newly-minted resource.

144
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,796
I know him as Colonel
James Rhodes.

145
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:50,628
The American people will soon
know him as the Iron Patriot.

146
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,670
And how is President
Ellis responding?

147
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:58,123
By taking the guy they call "War Machine"
and giving him a paint job.

148
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:02,376
The same suit but painted red,
white and blue, look at that.

149
00:10:02,377 --> 00:10:05,276
And they've also renamed
him Iron Patriot.

150
00:10:05,376 --> 00:10:08,808
You know, just in case the
paint was too subtle.

151
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,830
It tested well with focus
groups, alright?

152
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:12,601
- I am Iron Patriot.
- Listen.

153
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:14,589
War Machine was a little too
aggressive, alright.

154
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,732
This sends a better message.

155
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:21,266
So what's really going on?
With Mandarin.

156
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:24,798
Seriously, can we talk
about this guy?

157
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:29,960
It's classified information,
Tony.

158
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:33,143
- Okay, there've been nine bombings.
- Nine.

159
00:10:33,144 --> 00:10:34,775
The public only knows about three.

160
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,915
But here's the thing...
nobody can ID a device.

161
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:39,387
There's no bomb casings.

162
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,497
You know I can help.

163
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:44,970
Just ask. I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit. I got

164
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:45,491
Bomb disposal.

165
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:46,932
Catches explosions mid-air.

166
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:48,734
When's the last time you got
a good night's sleep?

167
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:51,603
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

168
00:10:51,604 --> 00:10:52,749
People are concerned about
you, Tony.

169
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,795
I'm concerned about you.

170
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:54,973
You gonna come at
me like that?

171
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:56,837
No, look, I'm not trying
to be a dic-

172
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,038
-tator.
- Would you mind signing my drawing?

173
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,675
If Richard doesn't mind. You alright
with this, Dick?

174
00:11:03,176 --> 00:11:04,072
Fine with me.

175
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,344
- What is your name?
- Erin.

176
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:11,376
I loved you in "A Christmas Story"
by the way.

177
00:11:12,266 --> 00:11:14,337
Listen, the Pentagon
is scared.

178
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:17,307
After New York, aliens,
come on.

179
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:18,719
They need to look strong.

180
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,012
Stopping the Mandarin is a
priority, but it's not-

181
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,822
It's not superhero business.

182
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:24,724
No, it's not. Quite frankly.

183
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,114
It's American business.

184
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:28,240
That's why I said.
I...got it.

185
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:29,636
Are you okay?

186
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:31,818
I broke the crayon.

187
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:33,448
Are you okay,
Mr. Stark?

188
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:35,588
Take it easy. Tony...

189
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,711
How did you get out
of the wormhole?

190
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:41,443
- Tony
- What did you say?

191
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:47,636
Sorry. Have to check on
the suit... make sure...okay.

192
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:53,710
Check the heart, check the,
check the, is it the brain?

193
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,002
No sign of cardiac analomy
or unusual brain activity.

194
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:59,024
Okay, so I was
poisoned?

195
00:11:59,313 --> 00:12:03,826
My diagnosis is that you've experienced
a severe anxiety attack.

196
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:07,458
Me?

197
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:10,219
Come on man, this isn't a
good look. Open up.

198
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,370
Sorry, I gotta split.

199
00:12:14,372 --> 00:12:19,985
Badge... Badge... Badge.

200
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:23,367
Badge, guys. I put a memo in
the toliet, come on.

201
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,487
Tony has got them in his basement,
they're wearing

202
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:27,429
party hats, this is an asset
we can put to use.

203
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,669
Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting
that I replace

204
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,953
the entire janitorial
staff with robots?

205
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:35,104
What I'm saying is that the human
element of Human

206
00:12:35,105 --> 00:12:37,115
Resources is our biggest
point of vulnerability.

207
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:38,956
We should start phasing it
out immediately.

208
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:40,877
- What!?
- Excuse me, Bambi

209
00:12:41,168 --> 00:12:43,240
- Did you just say that?
- Security

210
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:46,609
Happy, okay, I am thrilled that you're
now the Head of Security.

211
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,352
Okay, it is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

212
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:49,922
- However,
- I do appreciate it.

213
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:52,424
- Since you've taken the post,
- You don't have to thank me.

214
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:55,526
We've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300 percent.

215
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:58,187
- Thank you.
- That's not a compliment.

216
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:00,038
"That's not a compliment"?
It is a compliment!

217
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:01,849
Clearly somebody is trying
to hide something.

218
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:02,699
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

219
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,861
Miss Potts, your four o'clock
is here.

220
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:06,550
Did you clear this four o'clock
with me?

221
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,003
Happy, we'll talk about
this later

222
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:10,635
But right now I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

223
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:11,895
How so?

224
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,068
I used to work with him, and he
used to ask me

225
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,878
out all the time, so it's a
little awkward.

226
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,339
I don't like the
sound of that.

227
00:13:23,273 --> 00:13:26,014
- Pepper.
- Killian?

228
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,756
You look great...
you look really great.

229
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:31,863
God, you look great.

230
00:13:31,864 --> 00:13:35,179
I... I... I can't...What on Earth have
you been doing?

231
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,551
Nothing fancy, just five years in the
hands of physical therapists

232
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,772
And please, call me Aldrich.

233
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,436
Uh, you were supposed to be
issued a security badge?

234
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:44,204
Happy, it's okay.

235
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:45,605
- Yes?
- We're good.

236
00:13:45,606 --> 00:13:46,926
- You sure?
- Yes.

237
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,707
- Stand down.
- I'm going to linger.

238
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,138
- Thank you.
- Right here, okay.

239
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:51,968
It's very nice to see
you, Killian.

240
00:13:59,243 --> 00:14:00,954
Hey, guy

241
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,479
Merry Christmas.

242
00:14:10,064 --> 00:14:14,447
After years dodging the president's ban
on "Immoral Biotech Research",

243
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:20,307
My think tank now has a little
something in the pipeline.

244
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:25,504
It's an idea we like to call
"Extremis".

245
00:14:26,461 --> 00:14:28,077
I'm gonna turn your
lights down.

246
00:14:30,517 --> 00:14:32,570
Regard the human brain.

247
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,301
Uh, wait, hold on, hold on, that's, that's
the universe, my bad.

248
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:43,982
But if I do that...

249
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:53,007
That's the brain, strangely memetic
though, wouldn't you say?

250
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,326
- Wow, that's amazing!
- Thanks, it's mine.

251
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:59,538
- What?
- This... you're inside my head.

252
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:03,186
It's a live feed. Come on up,
I'll prove it to you.

253
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:06,897
Come on.

254
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:13,080
Now, pinch my arm. I can take it.
Pinch me.

255
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,216
What is that?

256
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,294
The primary somatosensory
cortex.

257
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:23,439
It's the brain's pain center, but this...
is what I wanted to show you.

258
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:29,480
Now, "Extremis" harnesses our
bioelectrical potential.

259
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:32,159
And it goes... here.

260
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,340
This is essentially an empty slot,
and what this tells us is that

261
00:15:36,341 --> 00:15:41,132
our mind, our entire DNA in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.

262
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:42,558
Wow.

263
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,413
Hello? Is this forehead
of Security?

264
00:15:54,419 --> 00:15:56,339
What? You know, look, I got a real job.
What do you want?

265
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,796
I'm working. I got something
going on here.

266
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:59,393
- What? Harassing interns?
- Let me tell you something,

267
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:01,364
You know what happened when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?

268
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:02,987
They would laugh
in my face.

269
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,446
I had to leave while I still
had a shred of dignity.

270
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,170
Now I got a real job. I'm
watching Pepper.

271
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,385
What's going on?
Fill me in.

272
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:10,876
- For real?
- Yeah.

273
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:14,295
Alright, so she's meeting up with this
scientist rich guy, handsome.

274
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:15,832
I couldn't make his face
at first, right?

275
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:16,770
And you know I'm good
with faces.

276
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:19,088
- Oh yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah, so I run his credentials

277
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:22,004
I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually
met the guy back in -

278
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,606
Where were we in '99? The
Science Conference?

279
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,788
Uh,  Switzerland.

280
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:27,343
Right, right, exactly.

281
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:29,547
- Killian, I don't remember that guy.
- Of course you don't remember,

282
00:16:29,548 --> 00:16:30,599
he's not a blonde with a big rack.

283
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:32,896
At first it was fine, they were
talking business, but now

284
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:35,505
it's like getting weird. He's showing
her his big brain.

285
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:38,463
- His what?
- Big brain, and she likes it.

286
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,685
Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?

287
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:44,658
Look at what? You watching them? Flip the
screen and then we can get started.

288
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:47,731
I'm not a tech genius like you, just
trust me, get down here.

289
00:16:47,732 --> 00:16:49,281
Flip the screen, then I can see
what they're doing.

290
00:16:49,282 --> 00:16:50,646
I don't know how to flip
the screen!

291
00:16:50,647 --> 00:16:52,994
Don't talk to me like that anymore.
You're not my boss.

292
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:57,147
Alright, I don't work for you, and
I don't trust this guy.

293
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:58,948
He's got another guy with
him, he's shifty.

294
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:01,149
Relax. I'm just asking you to
secure the perimeter.

295
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,836
Tell him to go out for a
drink or something.

296
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:04,937
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

297
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:06,833
This woman is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

298
00:17:06,834 --> 00:17:08,756
- And you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain?

299
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:10,883
Yeah, there's a giant brain,
there's a shifty character...

300
00:17:10,884 --> 00:17:12,368
I'm going to follow this guy.
I'm going to run

301
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,976
his plates and if it
gets rough, so be it.

302
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,711
I miss you, Happy.

303
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:19,093
Yeah, I miss you too but the
way it used to be.

304
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,331
Now you're off with
the 'superfriends'

305
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:21,886
I don't know what's going on
with you anymore.

306
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:22,779
The world's gettin' weird.

307
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,093
Hey I hate to cut you off, do you have
your taser on you?- Why?

308
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,300
I think there's a gal in HR
who is trying

309
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:29,756
to steal some printer ink. You should probably
go over there and zap her.

310
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:30,839
Yeah, nice.

311
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,126
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of

312
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:37,199
any living organism and
recode its DNA.

313
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:39,251
It would be incredible.

314
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:43,699
Unfortunately, to my ears it also
sounds highly weaponizable.

315
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,618
As in enhanced soldiers, private
armies, and Tony is not -

316
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:48,831
Tony, Tony.

317
00:17:49,632 --> 00:17:52,086
You know, I invited Tony
to join AIM.

318
00:17:52,686 --> 00:17:56,574
13 years ago and he
turned me down.

319
00:17:56,626 --> 00:18:01,609
But something tells me now there is a new genius
on the throne, who doesn't have to

320
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:06,069
answer to Tony anymore and who
has slightly less of an ego.

321
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:12,781
It's going to be a no, Aldrich...
as much as I'd like to help you.

322
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:20,100
I can't say that I'm not disappointed,
but as my father used to say,

323
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:22,413
"Failure is the fog through which
we glimpse triumph."

324
00:18:22,414 --> 00:18:26,293
It's very deep, and I have no
idea what it means.

325
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:28,489
Well, he was kind of an
idiot, my old man.

326
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:31,773
I'm sure I'll see you again,
Pepper.

327
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:43,656
Happy!

328
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,365
The car is ready... if you're
ready to go.

329
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:55,906
Yes, I just um, God, I forgot my other
thing so I'm just gonna...

330
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:27,245
I'm sorry I'm late. I was..
What is that?!

331
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:31,497
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like Mark 15?

332
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:35,257
Yeah, something like that. You know
everybody needs a hobby.

333
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:38,108
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

334
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:42,590
Just breaking it in, you know, it's always a little
pinchy in the GUI-bagger at first.

335
00:19:42,601 --> 00:19:45,022
Oh hey, did you see your
Christmas present?

336
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,327
Yes, I did. I don't know how I could have
missed that Christmas present.

337
00:19:49,328 --> 00:19:50,944
Is it gonna fit through
the door?

338
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:53,159
Well actually, uh, that's a good question,
I got a team of

339
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,259
guys coming tomorrow. They're gonna
blow out that wall.

340
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,855
So, uh, tense?
Good day?

341
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:00,498
Oh shoulders, a little naughty.
Naughty girl.

342
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:04,423
I don't want to harp on this, but did you
like the custom rabbit?

343
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:06,515
Did I like it?

344
00:20:06,516 --> 00:20:08,107
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

345
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:11,186
I appreciate the thought
very much.

346
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:16,020
So why don't you lift up that facemask
and give me a kiss.

347
00:20:16,739 --> 00:20:20,225
Huh, yup, damnit.
No can do.

348
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:24,730
You want to just kiss it on
the, uh, facial slit?

349
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,123
Why don't I run down to the
garage and see if

350
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:29,168
I can't find a crowbar to jimmy
that thing open?

351
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:33,342
A crowbar? Yeah. Oh, except there's
been a radiation leak.

352
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:35,217
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

353
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,255
At least let me get you
like a Hazmat suit.

354
00:20:39,754 --> 00:20:41,323
Or a Geiger counter or
something like that.

355
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:47,154
- Busted.
- This is a new level of lame.

356
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:50,421
- Sorry.
- You ate without me, already? On date night?

357
00:20:50,905 --> 00:20:52,478
- He was just.
- You mean you.

358
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:54,738
Well yeah, I just mean
we were just...

359
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:57,604
just hosting you while I
finished up a little work.

360
00:20:57,629 --> 00:20:57,940
Uh Huh..

361
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,520
And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know
if you were coming home

362
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,641
Or you were having drinks with
Aldrich Killian.

363
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:06,536
What?

364
00:21:07,837 --> 00:21:10,477
Aldrich Killian? What are you
checking up on me?

365
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:12,374
- Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me.

366
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:16,105
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on. Come on. Pep-

367
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:19,817
Hey, I admit it! My fault.
Sorry.

368
00:21:20,325 --> 00:21:22,281
I'm a piping hot mess.

369
00:21:24,683 --> 00:21:27,325
It's been going on for a while...
I haven't said anything.

370
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,698
- Nothing's been the same since New York.
- Oh really?

371
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:35,630
I didn't notice
that, at all.

372
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:40,646
You experience things and then they're over
and you still can't explain them.

373
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:44,709
Gods, aliens, other dimensions...
I'm just a man in a can.

374
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:49,556
The only reason I haven't cracked up is
probably because you've moved in.

375
00:21:49,557 --> 00:21:52,062
Which is great. I love
you, I'm lucky.

376
00:21:52,468 --> 00:21:55,981
But honey... I can't sleep.

377
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,883
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know, I tinker.

378
00:22:02,386 --> 00:22:04,501
The threat is imminent.

379
00:22:04,502 --> 00:22:07,144
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

380
00:22:08,344 --> 00:22:11,813
That's you. And my suits,
they're uh...

381
00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:14,291
- Machines.
- They're part of me.

382
00:22:15,933 --> 00:22:19,451
- A distraction.
- Maybe.

383
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:40,150
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Okay.

384
00:22:43,408 --> 00:22:47,246
- And you're going to join me.
- Better.

385
00:23:05,922 --> 00:23:07,214
Tony!

386
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,445
Power down!

387
00:23:24,865 --> 00:23:28,923
I must have called it in my sleep.
That's not supposed to happen.

388
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:34,308
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

389
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:42,138
Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my
breath, okay? Don't go, alright? Pepper?

390
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:45,149
I'm going to sleep downstairs.
Tinker with that.

391
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:14,605
- Can you regulate?
- Yes, I can regulate.

392
00:24:14,606 --> 00:24:16,546
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

393
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:27,949
It's a decent batch.

394
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,263
Don't say I never did
nothing for you.

395
00:24:31,264 --> 00:24:35,241
Thank you. I mean for
understanding.

396
00:24:44,688 --> 00:24:46,076
I'm sorry, buddy.

397
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:02,741
What're ya doing, buddy?

398
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:05,660
You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching
your favorite chick flick maybe?

399
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:08,130
Yeah, a little movie called
"The Party's Over"

400
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:11,248
Starring you and your junkie girlfriend,
and here's the ticket.

401
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:13,532
No kidding. That doesn't
belong to you.

402
00:25:39,796 --> 00:25:44,730
Savin! Help!
Help me!

403
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:12,710
A true story about fortune cookies.

404
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,374
They look Chinese. They
sound Chinese.

405
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:21,089
But they're actually an
American invention.

406
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:28,651
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies,
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.

407
00:27:29,797 --> 00:27:34,769
My disciples just destroyed another
cheap American knock-off.

408
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:39,892
The Chinese Theater.
Mr. President.

409
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,458
I know this must be
getting frustrating.

410
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:47,453
But this season of terror is
drawing to a close.

411
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:54,572
And don't worry, the big one is
coming, your graduation.

412
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,562
- Hi.
- Oh, uh.

413
00:28:10,687 --> 00:28:12,688
- Mind leaving that on?
- Sure.

414
00:28:19,468 --> 00:28:22,700
Sunday night's PBS,
"Downtown Abbey"

415
00:28:24,943 --> 00:28:26,377
That's the show. He thinks
it's elegant.

416
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:32,955
One more thing, make sure everyone wears
their badges. He's a stickler

417
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:35,410
for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't
let anyone in without them.

418
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:38,762
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

419
00:28:38,763 --> 00:28:40,853
We're hoping he'll give
us the reaction.

420
00:28:40,854 --> 00:28:42,876
His reaction to the
latest attack.

421
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:44,496
Mr. Stark!

422
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:48,534
Our sources are telling us that this is
another Mandarin attack.

423
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,334
Anything else you can tell us?

424
00:28:50,697 --> 00:28:55,701
Hey Mr. Stark! When is somebody going
to kill this guy? Just sayin'.

425
00:28:58,343 --> 00:29:00,071
Is that what you want?

426
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:06,290
Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been
wanting to send to the Mandarin.

427
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,231
I just didn't know how to
phrase it until now.

428
00:29:10,038 --> 00:29:12,602
My name is Tony Stark and
I'm not afraid of you.

429
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:16,008
I know that you're a coward,
so I've decided

430
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:18,920
That you just died, pal.

431
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:20,746
I'm gonna come get the body.

432
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:23,861
There's no politics here, it's just good
old-fashioned revenge.

433
00:29:24,094 --> 00:29:26,364
There's no Pentagon. It's just
you and me.

434
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:30,412
And on the off-chance you're a man,
here's my home address:

435
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:35,856
10880, Malibu Port, 90265.

436
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:40,016
I'll leave the door unlocked. That's what
you wanted, right?

437
00:29:42,774 --> 00:29:44,240
Bill me.

438
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,131
I've compiled a Mandarin
database for you, sir.

439
00:29:52,228 --> 00:29:55,801
Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I.
and C.I.A. intercepts.

440
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,129
Initiating virtual crimescene
reconstruction.

441
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:03,900
Okay, what do we got here?

442
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,950
His name is an ancient
Chinese war mantle

443
00:30:07,212 --> 00:30:08,530
Meaning "Advisor to the King".

444
00:30:09,338 --> 00:30:11,344
South American insurgency tactics.

445
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:13,738
Talks like a Bapist
preacher.

446
00:30:14,615 --> 00:30:17,959
There's lots of pagentry going
on here, lots of theatre.

447
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:22,988
Close. - The heat from the blast was
in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius.

448
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,704
Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporized instantly.

449
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:30,586
No bomb parts found in a 3-mile radius
of the Chinese theatre. - No, sir.

450
00:30:32,942 --> 00:30:34,436
Talk to me, Happy.

451
00:30:53,032 --> 00:30:55,438
When is a bomb not a bomb?

452
00:31:05,996 --> 00:31:09,455
- Any military victims?
- Not according to public records, sir.

453
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:13,527
Bring up the thermogenic signatures
again, factor in 3000 degrees.

454
00:31:13,528 --> 00:31:16,138
The oracle cloud has
completed analysis.

455
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:21,304
Accessing satellites and plotting the last 12
months of thermogenic occurances now.

456
00:31:22,405 --> 00:31:25,149
Take away everywhere that there's
been a Mandarin attack.

457
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:30,966
Nope.

458
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:39,652
That. You sure that's
not one of his?

459
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:42,066
It predates any known
Mandarin attack.

460
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,109
The incident was the use of a
bomb to assist a suicide.

461
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,135
Bring it around.

462
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:52,156
The heat signature is remarkably similar.
3000 degrees Celsius.

463
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,579
That's two military guys.

464
00:31:56,772 --> 00:31:58,241
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

465
00:31:58,242 --> 00:32:00,357
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.

466
00:32:07,196 --> 00:32:12,485
Are we still at 'Ding-Dong'? We're supposed
to be on total security lockdown.

467
00:32:12,486 --> 00:32:15,096
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

468
00:32:15,097 --> 00:32:20,148
There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give
the world's press your home address.

469
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,962
Right there's fine.

470
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:40,233
You're not the Mandarin, are you?
Are you?

471
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:45,195
You don't remember. Why I
am not surprised?

472
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,860
Don't take it personally, I don't remember
what I had for breakfast.

473
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:49,352
- Gluten-free waffles, sir.
- That's right.

474
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:54,164
Look, I need to be alone with you, someplace
not here... it's urgent.

475
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:59,659
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now
I'm in a committed relationship

476
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,768
- It's... with her.
- Tony

477
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:07,790
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

478
00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:13,097
Old botanist pal that I used
to know, barely.

479
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:16,569
Please don't tell me that there is a 12-year-old
kid waiting in the car that I've never met.

480
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,804
- He's 13. No, I need your help.
- What for? Why now?

481
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:24,251
Because I read the papers, and, frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

482
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,780
- I'll be fine.
- I'm sorry.

483
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:29,059
With Happy in the hospital, I didn't
know we were expecting guests.

484
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,907
We weren't.

485
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:31,762
- And old girlfriends!
- She's not really.

486
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:34,592
No, not really. It was
just one night.

487
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:37,996
- Yep.
- That's how you did it, isn't it?

488
00:33:37,997 --> 00:33:38,984
It was a great night

489
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,242
- Well... you know
- Yeah.

490
00:33:40,243 --> 00:33:42,120
You have saved yourself
a world of pain.

491
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:42,994
- What?
- Trust me.

492
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:44,130
We're going out of town.

493
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:45,997
- Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
- Yep!

494
00:33:45,998 --> 00:33:48,398
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

495
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,993
- Great idea. Let's go.
- I'm sorry.

496
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:52,277
That's a terrible idea. Please don't
touch her bags.

497
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:54,183
Tony, this is how normal
people behave.

498
00:33:54,184 --> 00:33:56,315
I can't protect you out there.
I challenged-

499
00:33:56,316 --> 00:33:57,926
- Is this normal?
- Sadly, that

500
00:33:57,927 --> 00:33:59,260
Yes, this is normal!

501
00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:02,110
- Is very normal
- It's a big bunny, relax about it!

502
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:04,559
- Calm down!
- I got this for you.

503
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,889
- I'm aware of that.
- You still haven't even told me that you liked it!

504
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,419
- I don't like it!
- I asked you three- You don't like it?!

505
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,792
We are leaving the house, that's not
even up for discussion. - Guys... do we umm...

506
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:16,136
- What?
- Do we need to worry about that?

507
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:07,309
- I got you.
- I got you first.

508
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:09,279
Like I said, we can't
stay here.

509
00:35:18,409 --> 00:35:20,481
Move! I'm right behind.

510
00:35:25,303 --> 00:35:26,532
Get her, I'm going to
find a way around.

511
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:30,670
Stop stopping! Get her.
Get outside! Go!

512
00:35:53,871 --> 00:35:55,561
Oh my God.
Tony!

513
00:36:09,485 --> 00:36:11,305
Sir, Miss Potts is clear
of the structure.

514
00:36:44,462 --> 00:36:46,142
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

515
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:48,167
Working on it, sir. This is
a prototype.

516
00:37:03,193 --> 00:37:04,270
That's one.

517
00:37:05,863 --> 00:37:08,947
Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.

518
00:37:23,999 --> 00:37:25,437
That's two.

519
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,975
Tony!

520
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,406
Sir, take a deep breath.

521
00:39:32,232 --> 00:39:33,795
Flight power restored.

522
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:51,480
Sir. Sir!

523
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:54,570
Alright, kill the
alarm. I got it.

524
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:59,085
That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.

525
00:40:35,822 --> 00:40:38,789
Snow? Where are we,
upstate?

526
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:41,444
We are 5 miles outside of
Rose Hills, Tennessee.

527
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,592
Why?

528
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:48,654
Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we
doing here, this is

529
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,533
thousands of miles away? I've gotta get
Pepper, I've got to -

530
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:52,724
I prepared a flight plan.

531
00:40:52,725 --> 00:40:54,178
This was the location.

532
00:40:54,232 --> 00:40:56,454
Who asked you? Open
the suit.

533
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:59,190
I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

534
00:40:59,191 --> 00:41:00,191
Open Eject.

535
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:07,696
That's brisk!

536
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:17,684
Maybe I'll just cozy back
up for a bit.

537
00:41:17,685 --> 00:41:20,795
I actually think I need
to sleep now, sir.

538
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,623
Jarvis.

539
00:41:24,128 --> 00:41:25,398
Jarvis?

540
00:41:28,633 --> 00:41:29,903
Don't leave me, buddy.

541
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:55,415
Stark Secure Server: Now transferring
to all known receivers.

542
00:41:55,464 --> 00:41:56,633
Pepper, it's me.

543
00:41:57,433 --> 00:42:01,728
I've got a lot of apologies to make and not
a lot of time, so first off.

544
00:42:02,628 --> 00:42:04,237
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

545
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:06,566
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

546
00:42:07,268 --> 00:42:11,026
Also, it's Christmas time. The
rabbit's too big. Done.

547
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:12,556
Sorry.

548
00:42:12,566 --> 00:42:17,090
And I'm sorry in advance because...
I can't come home yet.

549
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:22,168
I need to find this guy. You
gotta stay safe.

550
00:42:22,169 --> 00:42:23,628
That's all I know.

551
00:42:24,288 --> 00:42:26,895
I just stole a poncho from
a wooden Indian.

552
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:53,026
Let's get you comfy.

553
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:56,484
You happy now?

554
00:43:08,477 --> 00:43:09,633
Freeze!

555
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:13,900
- Don't move.
- You got me.

556
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:17,526
Nice potato gun.

557
00:43:18,426 --> 00:43:19,769
Barrel's a little long.

558
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:23,663
Between that and the wide gauge, it's
going to diminish your FPS.

559
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,250
And now you're out of ammo.

560
00:43:29,851 --> 00:43:31,268
What's that thing on
your chest?

561
00:43:32,682 --> 00:43:36,717
It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've
got a box of them right here.

562
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:38,493
What does it power?

563
00:43:47,347 --> 00:43:48,683
Oh my God!

564
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:57,360
- Is that Iron Man?
- Technically, I am.

565
00:43:57,361 --> 00:44:00,442
Technically, you're dead.

566
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:04,902
- A valid point.
- What happened to him?

567
00:44:04,903 --> 00:44:07,647
Life. I built him. I take
care of him.

568
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,650
I'll fix him.

569
00:44:12,651 --> 00:44:13,814
- Like a mechanic.
- Yeah.

570
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,740
If I was building Iron Man
and War Machine,

571
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:21,212
- It's Iron Patriot now.
- That's way cooler!

572
00:44:21,213 --> 00:44:22,374
No, it's not.

573
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,349
Anyway, I would have
added in the retro-

574
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:29,153
- Retroreflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

575
00:44:29,154 --> 00:44:30,486
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

576
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:33,015
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

577
00:44:33,893 --> 00:44:35,298
Not a good idea!

578
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:37,371
What are you doing? You're going
to break his finger?

579
00:44:37,372 --> 00:44:39,289
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

580
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:41,180
- Sorry.
- Are you?

581
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:44,849
Don't worry about it.
I'll fix it.

582
00:44:45,423 --> 00:44:46,688
So, uh, who's home?

583
00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:51,748
Well, my mom already left for the diner and
dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

584
00:44:52,134 --> 00:44:55,044
I guess he won 'cause that
was six years ago.

585
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,226
Which happens, dads leave. No need to
be a pussy about it.

586
00:45:00,227 --> 00:45:04,755
Here's what I need: a laptop, a
digital watch, a cell phone,

587
00:45:04,756 --> 00:45:07,846
The pneumatic actuator from
your bazooka over there,

588
00:45:07,847 --> 00:45:10,712
a map of town, a big spring,
and a tunafish sandwich.

589
00:45:10,713 --> 00:45:14,624
- What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name?

590
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:18,416
- Who?
- The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?

591
00:45:18,417 --> 00:45:20,934
How'd you know that?

592
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:22,693
I got just the thing.

593
00:45:24,956 --> 00:45:29,823
This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding.
it's a very powerful weapon.

594
00:45:30,225 --> 00:45:32,837
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

595
00:45:32,884 --> 00:45:34,576
It discourages bullying.

596
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:37,630
Non-lethal, just to cover
one's ass.

597
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:42,432
- Deal. Deal? What'd you say?
- Deal.

598
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,735
- What's your name?
- Harley

599
00:45:47,236 --> 00:45:51,386
- And yours...
- The mechanic : Tony

600
00:45:52,597 --> 00:45:54,449
You know what keeps going
through my head?

601
00:45:55,049 --> 00:45:56,690
Where's my sandwich?

602
00:46:36,005 --> 00:46:39,246
Stark Secure Server. Retinal
scan verified.

603
00:46:39,542 --> 00:46:40,627
Pepper, it's me.

604
00:46:40,918 --> 00:46:42,703
I've got a lot of apologies
to make

605
00:46:42,704 --> 00:46:44,438
and not a lot of time,
so first off.

606
00:46:44,777 --> 00:46:46,716
I'm so sorry I put you
in harm's way.

607
00:46:46,717 --> 00:46:49,471
That was selfish and stupid and
it won't happen again.

608
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:54,069
Why were you at the
house tonight?

609
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:57,531
What was so important that you
had to speak to Tony?

610
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:03,106
I think that my boss is working
for the Mandarin.

611
00:47:04,943 --> 00:47:06,626
So if you still want
to talk about it,

612
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:08,809
I suggest we get ourselves
someplace safe.

613
00:47:10,499 --> 00:47:13,313
Your boss works for the
Mandarin you think,

614
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:16,204
but Tony says you're a botanist.

615
00:47:16,205 --> 00:47:19,695
That figures. What I actually am is a biological
DNA coder running a team of

616
00:47:19,696 --> 00:47:23,232
40 out of a privately-funded think tank, but
sure you can call me a "botanist".

617
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,589
This boss of yours, does
he have a name?

618
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,177
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

619
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:36,031
Well we took the house down sir, but
there's no sign of a body.

620
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,643
- I see.
- No Stark.

621
00:47:37,743 --> 00:47:38,917
I have to go.

622
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:42,175
The Master is about to record
and he's a little...

623
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:44,722
Well you know how he gets.

624
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:47,716
Keep your appointment tonight and
call me when it's done.

625
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:56,203
Alright everybody. No talking and
no eye contact,

626
00:47:56,204 --> 00:47:58,177
unless you wanna get
shot in the face.

627
00:48:18,931 --> 00:48:20,598
The Master is travelling.

628
00:48:35,283 --> 00:48:37,282
Well then, what are we waiting for?

629
00:48:40,137 --> 00:48:42,383
The sandwich was fair, the
spring was a little

630
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:44,534
rusty, the rest of the materials
I'll make do.

631
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:47,899
By the way, when you said your
sister had a watch, I

632
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,191
was kinda hoping for something
a little more than that.

633
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:53,893
She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition.

634
00:48:54,492 --> 00:48:58,079
- When can we talk about New York?
- Maybe never, relax about it.

635
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,647
- What about the Avengers, can you talk about them?
- I don't know. later.

636
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:00,878
Hey kid, give me more space.

637
00:49:05,543 --> 00:49:09,202
What's the official story here?
What happened?

638
00:49:09,427 --> 00:49:13,361
I guess this guy named Chad Davis,
used to live roundabouts.

639
00:49:14,959 --> 00:49:17,152
Won a bunch of medals in the army.

640
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:21,443
One day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

641
00:49:22,038 --> 00:49:24,963
Then he blew himself
up right here.

642
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:32,880
- Six people died, right?
- Yes.

643
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:34,530
- Including Chad Davis?
- Yea.

644
00:49:43,028 --> 00:49:44,361
Doesn't make sense.

645
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:48,554
Think about it. Six dead,
only five shadows.

646
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:53,879
Yeah, but people said these shadows are
like the mark of souls gone to Heaven

647
00:49:54,442 --> 00:49:59,882
Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on
account of he didn't get a shadow.

648
00:50:00,236 --> 00:50:03,385
- That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that?

649
00:50:03,386 --> 00:50:04,985
That's what everyone says.

650
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:10,958
You know what this crater
reminds me of?

651
00:50:10,959 --> 00:50:12,994
I have no idea. I don't care.

652
00:50:14,416 --> 00:50:19,774
That giant wormhole, in
um, in New York.

653
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,121
Does it remind you?

654
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:23,845
That's manipulative. I don't want
to talk about it.

655
00:50:23,846 --> 00:50:26,291
Are they coming back?
The aliens?

656
00:50:26,292 --> 00:50:27,853
Maybe, can you stop?

657
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:31,234
Remember when I told you that
I have an anxiety issue?

658
00:50:31,235 --> 00:50:33,303
Does this subject make
you edgy?

659
00:50:33,304 --> 00:50:33,825
Yeah, a little bit.

660
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:36,076
Can I just catch my breath
for a second?

661
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:40,114
Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you need
a plastic bag to breathe into?

662
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:41,750
- Do you have medication?
- Nope.

663
00:50:42,035 --> 00:50:43,372
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

664
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,410
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

665
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:47,126
Are you going completely
mental?

666
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,111
I can stop, do you want
me to stop?

667
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:50,876
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

668
00:50:50,877 --> 00:50:52,814
I swear to God, you're going
to freak me out.

669
00:50:54,856 --> 00:50:56,914
Ah man, you did it, didn't you?

670
00:50:56,915 --> 00:50:59,169
- You happy now?
- What did I say?

671
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:03,483
Hey, wait up!
Wait, wait.

672
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:10,261
What the hell was that?

673
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:16,617
Your fault, you spazzed
me out.

674
00:51:18,182 --> 00:51:20,187
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

675
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:25,491
The guy who died... relatives?Mom?
Ms. Davis, where is she?

676
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,500
- Where she always is.
- See, now you're being helpful.

677
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:39,307
Sorry. Lady, this uh,

678
00:51:40,708 --> 00:51:42,318
Thank you.

679
00:51:44,641 --> 00:51:45,942
Nice haircut, suits you.

680
00:51:47,711 --> 00:51:50,214
- Nice watch.
- Yeah, limited edition.

681
00:51:50,614 --> 00:51:52,102
Oh, I don't doubt it.

682
00:51:53,759 --> 00:51:55,418
Well have a good evening.

683
00:52:18,518 --> 00:52:22,355
Ms. Davis, Mind if
I join you?

684
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:24,963
- Free country.
- It sure is.

685
00:52:29,966 --> 00:52:31,089
Alright

686
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:37,304
- Where'd you like to start?
- I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss.

687
00:52:37,857 --> 00:52:39,891
I want to know what you
think happened

688
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:47,795
I brought your damn file.
You take it and go.

689
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,020
Whatever was in here, he
wanted no part of it.

690
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:56,497
Clearly, you were waiting for someone else.
Supposed to meet somebody here?

691
00:52:57,498 --> 00:52:58,508
Yeah.

692
00:53:11,859 --> 00:53:15,427
Ms. Davis, your son didn't kill
himself. I guarantee

693
00:53:15,428 --> 00:53:19,418
you he didn't kill anyone.
Someone used him.

694
00:53:20,466 --> 00:53:23,733
- What?
- As a weapon.

695
00:53:27,524 --> 00:53:30,989
You're not the person who called
me after all, are you?

696
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,944
Actually, I am.

697
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:40,818
Hey, hey! What's all this about?
The hell's going on here?

698
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:42,527
It's called an arrest.

699
00:53:43,907 --> 00:53:46,640
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?

700
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:51,084
- Homeland Security. We good here?
- No, we're not good.

701
00:53:51,085 --> 00:53:55,087
- I need a little more information than that.
- Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

702
00:53:55,088 --> 00:53:59,389
Yeah, well, why don't you get on the
horn to Nashville and upgrade me?

703
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:02,451
Alright, you know what, I was hoping
to do this the smart way, but uh,

704
00:54:02,571 --> 00:54:04,732
The fun way's always good.

705
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:07,134
Deputy, get this woman and-

706
00:54:21,222 --> 00:54:23,942
Hey hot wings, you wanna party?
You and me, let's go.

707
00:54:36,976 --> 00:54:39,079
- Crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

708
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:41,840
Watch this.

709
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:50,620
You walked right into this one. I've dated
hotter chicks than you.

710
00:55:52,661 --> 00:55:56,904
That's all you got? Cheap trick
and a cheesy one-liner?

711
00:55:56,905 --> 00:55:59,266
Sweetheart, that could be the name
of my autobiography.

712
00:57:01,301 --> 00:57:03,342
- Let me go!
- Help me! Help me!

713
00:57:09,547 --> 00:57:12,028
Hey kid, what would you
like for Christmas?

714
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,729
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry.

715
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,870
No, no, I think he was trying to say
"I want my goddamn file."

716
00:57:17,192 --> 00:57:19,153
It's not your fault kid.

717
00:57:21,353 --> 00:57:23,094
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

718
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:32,319
You like that, West World? That's
the thing about smart guys.

719
00:57:32,879 --> 00:57:35,001
We always cover our ass.

720
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:01,055
You're welcome!

721
00:58:02,337 --> 00:58:05,799
- For what? Did I miss something?
- Me saving your life.

722
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,400
A: Saved you first
B: Thanks, sort of

723
00:58:08,942 --> 00:58:11,562
And C: If you do someone a solid, don't
be a yutz alright,

724
00:58:11,563 --> 00:58:14,084
just play it cool otherwise you
come off grandiose.

725
00:58:15,785 --> 00:58:17,426
Unlike you?

726
00:58:18,547 --> 00:58:21,689
Admit it: you need me.
We're connected.

727
00:58:21,828 --> 00:58:24,090
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

728
00:58:24,091 --> 00:58:26,951
keep your trap shut, and
guard the suit.

729
00:58:26,952 --> 00:58:28,667
And stay connected to the
telephone because

730
00:58:28,668 --> 00:58:29,972
if I call you better
pick up. Okay?

731
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:32,674
Can you feel that?
We're done here.

732
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:35,777
Move out of the way or I'm going to
run you over. Bye kid.

733
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:46,448
I'm sorry kid. You
did good.

734
00:58:46,449 --> 00:58:49,749
So now you're just going to leave
you here, like my dad?

735
00:58:50,765 --> 00:58:54,992
Yeah. Wait, you're guilt-tripping
me, aren't you?

736
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:56,749
I'm cold

737
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:59,831
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

738
00:59:00,251 --> 00:59:01,592
'Cause we're connected.

739
00:59:05,895 --> 00:59:07,975
It was worth a shot.

740
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:27,847
What happened to the picture?

741
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:39,834
The entire East coast.. the
satellites are down.

742
00:59:42,215 --> 00:59:43,697
We have an unauthorized broadcast

743
00:59:44,227 --> 00:59:46,271
Mr. Vice President, I think
you should see this.

744
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:50,842
Oh my God, not again.

745
00:59:52,044 --> 00:59:54,074
Is the President getting this?

746
01:00:04,594 --> 01:00:06,495
Mr. President.

747
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:08,596
Only two lessons remain.

748
01:00:09,278 --> 01:00:12,078
I intend to finish this before
Christmas morning.

749
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,762
Meet Thomas Richards. Good strong
name, good strong job.

750
01:00:19,123 --> 01:00:23,726
Thomas here is an accountant for
the Roxxon Oil Corporation.

751
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:29,050
And I'm sure he's a
really good guy.

752
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:37,093
I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on
your television, in 30 seconds.

753
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:42,577
The number for this telephone is in your
cell phone. Exciting, isn't it?

754
01:00:42,857 --> 01:00:44,938
Imagining how it got there.

755
01:00:45,137 --> 01:00:51,362
America, if your president calls me in
the next half-minute, Tom lives.

756
01:00:51,662 --> 01:00:52,622
Go.

757
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,159
How did he hack my phone?

758
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:58,066
We can't allow terrorists
to dictate

759
01:00:58,067 --> 01:00:59,273
I have to make this call.

760
01:00:59,274 --> 01:01:00,867
I'd strongly advise
against that.

761
01:01:00,868 --> 01:01:02,468
This is the right
thing to do.

762
01:01:30,364 --> 01:01:32,837
There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis,

763
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:35,046
so run away and kiss your
children goodbye

764
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:37,184
Because nothing, not your army,
not your red,

765
01:01:37,185 --> 01:01:39,090
white, and blue attack dog,
can save you.

766
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:43,932
I'll see you soon.

767
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:49,585
Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic
right now.

768
01:01:49,586 --> 01:01:52,257
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

769
01:01:52,258 --> 01:01:55,176
We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

770
01:01:55,177 --> 01:01:56,020
- Right now!
- Yes, sir.

771
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:28,638
Don't move!

772
01:02:35,843 --> 01:02:36,844
Uh, hang on a second.

773
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:38,596
Hello.

774
01:02:38,597 --> 01:02:43,845
You ever look up and everything starts glowing from
the inside out, a kind of bright orange.

775
01:02:44,447 --> 01:02:46,890
- Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?
- It's me, pal.

776
01:02:46,891 --> 01:02:50,091
Now last time I went missing, if I remember
correctly, you went looking for me.

777
01:02:50,092 --> 01:02:53,209
- What are you doing?
- A little talking, making friends in Pakistan.

778
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:54,515
What are you doing?

779
01:02:54,516 --> 01:02:57,896
Your re-design, your big re-brand,
that was AIM, right? - Yeah.

780
01:02:58,496 --> 01:03:02,178
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comsat
right now, I need your login.

781
01:03:02,518 --> 01:03:04,357
Same as it's always been,
War Machine 68.

782
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:05,320
And password please?

783
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,907
Well, look, I gotta change it every time
you hack in, Tony.

784
01:03:07,908 --> 01:03:10,942
It's not the eighties, nobody says "hack"
anymore, give me your login.

785
01:03:12,464 --> 01:03:15,526
"War Machine Rox" with
an X, all caps.

786
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:23,230
- Yeah okay.
- That is so much better than Iron Patriot.

787
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:06,882
That ain't gonna cut it.

788
01:04:09,563 --> 01:04:11,725
Excuse me sir, I don't know who...

789
01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:17,128
Mom, I need to call you back. Something
magical is happening.

790
01:04:17,848 --> 01:04:19,785
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

791
01:04:19,786 --> 01:04:21,770
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

792
01:04:21,771 --> 01:04:23,166
I knew you were still alive!

793
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:24,812
Come on in and close the door.

794
01:04:29,855 --> 01:04:31,417
- Wow, can I just say sir?
- Yeah.

795
01:04:32,737 --> 01:04:33,682
I am your biggest fan.

796
01:04:33,683 --> 01:04:36,220
First, is this your van or
is anyone else gonna come in?

797
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:37,409
No, no, it's just us.

798
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,540
What's your name?

799
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,735
- Gary.
- Gary.

800
01:04:40,961 --> 01:04:42,061
Oh wow.

801
01:04:42,062 --> 01:04:46,104
Right there's fine. I get a
lot of this, it's okay.

802
01:04:46,105 --> 01:04:47,424
Can I just say?

803
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:51,189
- Yeah.
- I don't know if you can tell but I have like

804
01:04:51,709 --> 01:04:54,693
Patterned my whole look after you. My
hair's a little,

805
01:04:54,694 --> 01:04:57,351
it's not right because there's
some product in it.

806
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:57,511
Right.

807
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:01,587
I don't want to make things
awkward for you

808
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:03,795
- No.
- But I do have to show you... boom!

809
01:05:05,037 --> 01:05:06,537
Hispanic Scott Baio?

810
01:05:07,677 --> 01:05:09,238
- Oh, I'm sorry, is that me?
- Yeah.

811
01:05:09,638 --> 01:05:12,537
It's... I mean. I had them do it
off a doll that I made,

812
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:15,762
so it's not like it's off a picture. So
it's a little bit-

813
01:05:15,763 --> 01:05:18,283
Jerry, for a moment, listen
to me here.

814
01:05:19,004 --> 01:05:20,953
I don't want to clip your
wings here.

815
01:05:20,954 --> 01:05:22,646
We're both a little over-excited.

816
01:05:22,966 --> 01:05:25,489
I have an issue. I'm chasing bad
guys, trying to grapple

817
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,569
with something from some
hard-crypt data files.

818
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:29,190
I don't have enough juice.

819
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,051
I need you to jump on the roof,
recalibrate the ISDNs

820
01:05:33,652 --> 01:05:36,788
- Pump it up by about 40%.
- Got it.

821
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:37,575
Alright, it's a mission.

822
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,374
Yeah.

823
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:40,037
Tony needs Gary.

824
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:41,487
And Gary needs Tony.

825
01:05:41,488 --> 01:05:42,537
Be quiet about it.

826
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:43,838
Go.

827
01:06:06,432 --> 01:06:09,354
What would you regard as the defining
moment of your life?

828
01:06:09,673 --> 01:06:13,316
Well uh, I think that would be the day I decided
not to let my injury beat me.

829
01:06:15,677 --> 01:06:18,600
- Can you please state your name for the camera?
- Ellen Brandt.

830
01:06:18,919 --> 01:06:23,282
Okay, so, the injections are
administered periodically.

831
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:27,765
Addiction will not be tolerated and those who cannot
regulate will be cut from the program.

832
01:06:28,966 --> 01:06:36,050
Once misfits, cripples... you are the next
iteration of human evolution.

833
01:06:40,332 --> 01:06:44,263
Hi everybody. Before we start, I promise you, looking back
at your life there will be

834
01:06:44,264 --> 01:06:48,376
nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk that
you prudently elected to forego.

835
01:06:49,877 --> 01:06:52,099
Today is your glory. Let's begin!

836
01:07:03,425 --> 01:07:06,307
We gotta get out of here! Gotta get out of here!
Get 'em out! Get 'em out of here!

837
01:07:13,311 --> 01:07:15,673
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

838
01:07:18,113 --> 01:07:20,395
This stuff doesn't always
work, right, pal?

839
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:22,896
It's faulty, but you found a
buyer, didn't ya?

840
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:25,458
Sold it to the Mandarin.

841
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:34,322
What happened? Fun fact.

842
01:07:35,325 --> 01:07:38,086
Before he built rockets
for the Nazis.

843
01:07:38,445 --> 01:07:47,410
The idealistic Werner von Braun dreamed
of space travel... he stargazed.

844
01:07:48,451 --> 01:07:52,413
You know what he said when the
first V2 hit London?

845
01:07:53,134 --> 01:07:56,456
The rocket performed perfectly.

846
01:07:58,258 --> 01:08:00,539
It just landed on the wrong planet.

847
01:08:02,259 --> 01:08:07,142
See we all begin wide-eyed...
"pure science".

848
01:08:07,662 --> 01:08:11,905
Then the ego steps in,
the obsession

849
01:08:13,466 --> 01:08:19,708
And when you look up, you're
a long way from shore.

850
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:26,874
You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean
you gave your research to a think tank.

851
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:30,307
Yeah but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

852
01:08:30,308 --> 01:08:32,277
That's exactly what we used to do.

853
01:08:32,838 --> 01:08:34,399
So don't judge yourself.

854
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:37,839
Thank you, Pepper.

855
01:08:39,761 --> 01:08:41,282
I really appreciate that.

856
01:08:49,167 --> 01:08:49,682
Hi, good evening

857
01:08:49,683 --> 01:08:50,948
- Good evening.
- Come on in.

858
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:54,490
Maya, run!

859
01:08:56,811 --> 01:08:57,932
Hi Pepper.

860
01:09:00,173 --> 01:09:02,373
So you want to tell me why you were
at Stark's manison last night?

861
01:09:02,454 --> 01:09:05,855
I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and
the Master were gonna blow the place up.

862
01:09:06,377 --> 01:09:10,357
Oh I see, so you were trying to save Stark...
when he threatened us

863
01:09:10,358 --> 01:09:11,781
I told you, Killian, we can use him.

864
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:14,905
Pepper, Pepper, Pepper

865
01:09:14,906 --> 01:09:18,465
Look if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

866
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:21,924
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now he has one.

867
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:31,929
This is Support Team Blue 0, sending coordinates for
suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

868
01:09:31,930 --> 01:09:32,505
Copy.

869
01:09:40,838 --> 01:09:41,917
Nobody move!

870
01:09:46,841 --> 01:09:49,948
Support Blue 0, unless the Mandarin's
next attack on the U.S.

871
01:09:49,949 --> 01:09:53,004
involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think
you messed up again.

872
01:09:54,525 --> 01:09:59,487
Yes, you're free, if you weren't
before. Yes ma'am.

873
01:09:59,688 --> 01:10:03,450
Iron Patriot on the job, happy to help,no need
to thank me, it's my pleasure.

874
01:10:12,996 --> 01:10:15,498
Savin, I've acquired the Patriot armor.

875
01:10:15,499 --> 01:10:19,439
You want this suit? You're going ot have
to pry my cold, dead body out of it.

876
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,920
That's the plan, Colonel.

877
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,816
Harley, tell me what is happening,
give me a full report.

878
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:28,524
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy, do you
want me to keep eating it?

879
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:29,925
How much did you have?

880
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:30,926
Two or three bowls.

881
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:33,231
- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.

882
01:10:33,232 --> 01:10:35,207
That means you're fine,
give me Jarvis.

883
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:36,710
Jarvis, how are we?

884
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:39,136
It's totally fine sir. I seem to do quite
well for a stretch and

885
01:10:39,137 --> 01:10:41,332
then at the end of the sentence I
say the wrong cranberry.

886
01:10:41,712 --> 01:10:45,059
And sir, you were right. Once I factored
in available AIM downlink

887
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:48,356
facilities I was able to pinpoint the
Mandarin's broadcast signal.

888
01:10:49,056 --> 01:10:53,159
What're we talkin'? The Far East, Europe, North
Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, where is it?

889
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:54,780
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

890
01:10:54,781 --> 01:10:58,391
Okay, kid, I'm going to have to walk
you through rebooting Jarvis's

891
01:10:58,392 --> 01:11:00,523
speech drive, but not right now.

892
01:11:00,948 --> 01:11:02,023
Harley, where is he really?

893
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,705
Just look on the screen and
tell me where it is.

894
01:11:05,466 --> 01:11:06,911
Um...it does say Miami, Florida.

895
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:09,468
Okay, first things first,
I need the armor.

896
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:10,982
Where are we at with it?

897
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:12,150
Uh, it's not charging.

898
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:22,859
Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power
source is questionable.

899
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,398
It may not succeed in revitalizing
the Mark 42.

900
01:11:25,399 --> 01:11:27,688
What's questionable about electricity?

901
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:30,801
Alright, it's my suit and I can't...
I'm not gonna...

902
01:11:31,841 --> 01:11:35,203
- Oh God, not again.
- Tony

903
01:11:37,165 --> 01:11:40,386
Are you having another attack? I didn't even
mention New York.

904
01:11:40,387 --> 01:11:44,169
Right, and then you just said it, by name,
while denying having said it.

905
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:45,349
Okay, um, uh

906
01:11:48,092 --> 01:11:49,704
Oh God, what am I gonna do?

907
01:11:49,705 --> 01:11:51,853
Just breathe, really just breathe.

908
01:11:53,054 --> 01:11:56,576
- You're a mechanic, right?
- Right.

909
01:11:57,776 --> 01:12:01,137
- You said so.
- Yes, I did.

910
01:12:02,098 --> 01:12:04,140
What don't you just build something?

911
01:12:16,948 --> 01:12:19,749
Okay, thanks kid.

912
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:08,013
Why is it so hot in here? I told
you to put it at 68.

913
01:14:08,813 --> 01:14:12,615
My fault again...let me tell you something
sweetheart, I am not your personal-

914
01:15:15,732 --> 01:15:17,614
I wouldn't go in there for twenty minutes!

915
01:15:19,034 --> 01:15:22,256
- Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me.

916
01:15:22,269 --> 01:15:24,471
Ah, Nessie.

917
01:15:24,757 --> 01:15:29,343
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

918
01:15:29,344 --> 01:15:31,761
There's some guy over here.

919
01:15:31,762 --> 01:15:35,184
They're made by Americans, based
on the Japanese recipes. - Hey!

920
01:15:37,311 --> 01:15:39,312
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

921
01:15:39,337 --> 01:15:40,938
- Don't move.
- I am not moving.

922
01:15:40,947 --> 01:15:43,633
If you want something, take it, although
the guns are all fake

923
01:15:43,634 --> 01:15:46,150
because those wankers wouldn't trust
me with the real ones.

924
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:48,531
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

925
01:15:49,092 --> 01:15:53,634
Heard enough. You're not him, the Mandarin,
the real guy, where?

926
01:15:54,635 --> 01:15:58,957
- Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
- He's here. He's here.

927
01:15:59,177 --> 01:16:01,979
- But he's not here. He's here but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

928
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:04,466
It's complicated, hey, it's
complicated, alright?

929
01:16:04,467 --> 01:16:05,801
- It is?
- It's complicated.

930
01:16:05,802 --> 01:16:07,346
Uncomplicate it. Ladies out, get out
of the bed

931
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:08,682
get in the bathroom.

932
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:12,042
Sit.

933
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:25,074
My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery.

934
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:26,414
What are you?

935
01:16:27,574 --> 01:16:29,601
What're you a decoy? You're
a double, right?

936
01:16:29,602 --> 01:16:31,456
What? No. An understudy?
Absolutely not.

937
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:34,058
Don't hurt me please!
I'm an actor.

938
01:16:35,157 --> 01:16:37,911
You got a minute to live, fill it
with words.

939
01:16:38,612 --> 01:16:41,903
It's just a role. "The Mandarin", see,
it's not real.

940
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:43,823
Then how did you get here,
Trevor?

941
01:16:46,505 --> 01:16:52,130
Um, well, uh, I have a little problem
with, um, substances,

942
01:16:52,131 --> 01:16:56,911
and I ended up doing things...
no two ways about it

943
01:16:56,912 --> 01:17:00,193
- In the street that a man shouldn't do.
- Next!

944
01:17:00,194 --> 01:17:05,596
Then, they approached me about the role
and they knew about the drugs.

945
01:17:05,597 --> 01:17:07,213
What'd they say they'd get
you off them?

946
01:17:07,214 --> 01:17:08,238
Said they'd give me more.

947
01:17:08,598 --> 01:17:11,662
They gave me things. They gave
me this palace.

948
01:17:11,663 --> 01:17:14,922
They gave me plastic surgery. They
gave me things.

949
01:17:16,643 --> 01:17:18,043
Did you just nod off?

950
01:17:19,204 --> 01:17:23,287
No, the lovely speedboat! And the
thing was, he needed someone.

951
01:17:23,688 --> 01:17:27,290
To take credit for some
"accidental explosions".

952
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,691
"He"?

953
01:17:34,332 --> 01:17:36,534
- Killian?
- Killian.

954
01:17:36,535 --> 01:17:38,857
- He created you?
- He created me.

955
01:17:40,057 --> 01:17:42,258
- Custom-made terror threat
- Yes!

956
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:47,861
Yes, his think tank thinked it up, the
pathology of the serial killer.

957
01:17:48,301 --> 01:17:51,343
The manipulation of Western
iconography.

958
01:17:51,783 --> 01:17:55,987
Ready for another lesson?
Blah blah blah.

959
01:17:57,787 --> 01:18:00,747
Of course, it was my performance that
brought the Mandarin to life.

960
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:06,312
Your performance? Where
people die?

961
01:18:07,272 --> 01:18:09,774
No, no, look around you,
costumes, green screen.

962
01:18:10,074 --> 01:18:14,316
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff,
and when I was, movie magic, love.

963
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:17,998
I'm sorry but I got a best friend who's in
a coma and he might not wake up.

964
01:18:17,999 --> 01:18:21,481
So you're going to have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.

965
01:18:27,863 --> 01:18:30,666
Okay, Trevor, what'd you tell him?

966
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:33,447
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

967
01:18:34,968 --> 01:18:37,690
- No.
- You should have pressed the panic button.

968
01:18:38,530 --> 01:18:40,572
Well I panicked, but then
I handled it.

969
01:19:02,994 --> 01:19:04,714
Just like old times, huh?

970
01:19:04,715 --> 01:19:07,396
Oh yeah, with zip-ties.
It's a ball.

971
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:08,940
It wasn't my idea.

972
01:19:08,941 --> 01:19:11,399
Okay, so you took
Killian's card

973
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:12,349
I took his money.

974
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:15,161
And here you are 13 years
later in a dungeon.

975
01:19:15,361 --> 01:19:16,242
- No.
- Yeah.

976
01:19:16,342 --> 01:19:20,364
- No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
- Yeah...

977
01:19:24,246 --> 01:19:28,599
A lot's happened Tony,
and I'm close.

978
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:31,950
Extremis is pratically stable.

979
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:32,290
I'm telling you it isn't.

980
01:19:32,291 --> 01:19:36,954
I saw him on the street, people are going 'bang', they're
painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

981
01:19:36,955 --> 01:19:39,835
Then help me fix it.

982
01:19:43,859 --> 01:19:44,860
Did I do that?

983
01:19:47,021 --> 01:19:49,423
- Yes.
- I remember the night, not the morning

984
01:19:50,144 --> 01:19:51,324
Is this what you've been
chasing around?

985
01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:52,504
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

986
01:19:54,626 --> 01:19:59,829
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.

987
01:20:00,749 --> 01:20:04,592
Wanted to help people, now
look at you.

988
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:08,414
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who...

989
01:20:11,141 --> 01:20:12,341
still has a soul.

990
01:20:18,721 --> 01:20:23,323
Get me out of here,
come on.

991
01:20:25,164 --> 01:20:30,247
You know what my old man used to say to me?
His favorite of many sayings.

992
01:20:31,207 --> 01:20:35,729
"The early bird gets the worm, the second
mouse gets the cheese".

993
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,343
You're not still pissed about the Switzerland
thing, are you?

994
01:20:38,344 --> 01:20:39,692
How can I be pissed you, Tony?

995
01:20:40,412 --> 01:20:42,583
I'm here to thank you. You've
given me the

996
01:20:42,584 --> 01:20:44,855
greatest gift that anybody's
ever given me.

997
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:48,627
Desperation. If you think
back to Switzerland,

998
01:20:48,628 --> 01:20:51,379
you said you'd meet me on
the rooftop, right?

999
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:57,493
Well for the first 20 minutes, I actually
thought you'd show up.

1000
01:20:57,794 --> 01:20:59,843
For the next hour, I uhh...

1001
01:21:00,443 --> 01:21:07,108
Well I considered taking that one step shortcut
to the lobby, if you know I mean.

1002
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:10,031
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1003
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:13,846
But as I looked out over that city, nobody
knew I was there,

1004
01:21:13,947 --> 01:21:16,574
nobody could see me, no one
was even looking.

1005
01:21:16,774 --> 01:21:21,918
I had a thought that would guide
me for years to come.

1006
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:24,158
Anonymity, Tony.

1007
01:21:25,639 --> 01:21:28,823
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra
ever since, right?

1008
01:21:28,824 --> 01:21:31,122
You simply rule from behind
the scenes.

1009
01:21:31,123 --> 01:21:33,444
Because the second you
give evil a face

1010
01:21:33,604 --> 01:21:37,266
Bin Laden, Gaddafi, The Mandarin

1011
01:21:37,447 --> 01:21:38,589
You hand the people a target.

1012
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:39,567
You're something else.

1013
01:21:42,612 --> 01:21:43,889
You have met him, I assume?

1014
01:21:43,890 --> 01:21:45,213
Yeah, Sir Lawrence Oblivion.

1015
01:21:45,494 --> 01:21:48,656
I know he's a little over the top sometimes...
it's not entirely my fault.

1016
01:21:48,657 --> 01:21:50,818
He has a tend...he's
a stage actor.

1017
01:21:51,617 --> 01:21:54,179
They say his Lear was the toast of
Croydon, wherever that is.

1018
01:21:54,779 --> 01:21:59,181
Anyway, the point is ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky.

1019
01:22:00,062 --> 01:22:01,864
Subtlety's kinda had its day.

1020
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:03,744
What's next for you in your world?

1021
01:22:03,745 --> 01:22:08,588
Well, I wanted to repay you for the same gift
you so graciously imparted to me.

1022
01:22:16,071 --> 01:22:20,913
Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not
sure if you can tell.

1023
01:22:21,435 --> 01:22:27,158
But at this moment the body is trying to decide
whether to accept Extremis or just give up.

1024
01:22:27,217 --> 01:22:32,839
And if it gives up, I have to say the denotation
is quite spectactular.

1025
01:22:34,722 --> 01:22:37,444
But until that point, it's really
just a lot of pain.

1026
01:22:38,163 --> 01:22:41,847
We haven't even talked
salary yet.

1027
01:22:42,647 --> 01:22:45,532
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1028
01:22:45,633 --> 01:22:46,770
Let him go.

1029
01:22:48,529 --> 01:22:53,693
- Hold on, hold on. Maya
- I said let him go!

1030
01:22:54,374 --> 01:22:55,682
What are you doing?

1031
01:22:55,683 --> 01:22:58,856
1200ccs, a dose half of this
size and I'm dead.

1032
01:22:59,336 --> 01:23:02,980
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1033
01:23:02,981 --> 01:23:05,060
Maya, give me the injector.

1034
01:23:05,061 --> 01:23:10,503
If I die Killian, what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1035
01:23:10,504 --> 01:23:11,703
We're not doing this, okay?

1036
01:23:11,704 --> 01:23:14,145
What happens to you? What happens
if you go too hot?

1037
01:23:27,673 --> 01:23:32,076
The good news is, a high level position
has just been vacated.

1038
01:23:40,302 --> 01:23:43,322
-You're a maniac.
- No, I'm a visionary.

1039
01:23:45,284 --> 01:23:49,846
But I do own a maniac, and he takes
the stage tonight.

1040
01:23:53,568 --> 01:23:57,212
When we get the Iron Patriot, it'll take me
nine to ten minutes for a take down.

1041
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,773
That's great. The last time I looked
there was somebody inside of it.

1042
01:24:07,256 --> 01:24:08,898
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1043
01:24:11,939 --> 01:24:14,620
Hello Colonel.

1044
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:16,262
Step aside.

1045
01:24:24,387 --> 01:24:27,150
We'll get you out of there,
don't worry.

1046
01:24:27,351 --> 01:24:29,229
You'll damage the armor.

1047
01:24:29,709 --> 01:24:33,512
Yes, I will, but you can
fix it, right?

1048
01:24:34,392 --> 01:24:37,634
I'm going to take the suit up to base
camp, and I want Potts with me.

1049
01:24:38,235 --> 01:24:40,356
She's still in Phase 2.

1050
01:24:41,136 --> 01:24:43,658
You're not going deaf, are ya?

1051
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,208
Careful there, it's a limited edition.

1052
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:03,969
Hey, uh, ponytail express.

1053
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:07,451
What is the mileage count between Tennessee
and Miami? - 832 miles.

1054
01:25:07,772 --> 01:25:09,813
Very nice.

1055
01:25:11,374 --> 01:25:13,895
- Are you gonna stop that?
- Break it you bought it.

1056
01:25:16,658 --> 01:25:19,852
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away, that
belongs to my friend's sister,

1057
01:25:19,853 --> 01:25:23,102
and that's why I'm gonna
kill you first.

1058
01:25:23,581 --> 01:25:24,702
- What're ya gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1059
01:25:25,102 --> 01:25:28,624
- You're zip-tied to a bed.
- This.

1060
01:25:32,106 --> 01:25:33,547
That.

1061
01:25:37,869 --> 01:25:39,311
Are you comin' out?

1062
01:25:42,112 --> 01:25:46,274
Do not open, do not open, don't open, don't
open, don't- Alright, let's go.

1063
01:25:53,558 --> 01:25:56,281
You breathe fire? Okay.

1064
01:25:59,882 --> 01:26:02,884
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1065
01:26:03,204 --> 01:26:08,848
This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most
powerful leader in one hand.

1066
01:26:08,849 --> 01:26:12,049
And the world's most feared
terrorist in the other.

1067
01:26:12,890 --> 01:26:15,011
I'll own the War on Terror.

1068
01:26:16,492 --> 01:26:21,376
Creates supply and demand for you
and your brothers and sisters.

1069
01:26:24,537 --> 01:26:29,740
Trust me, you're going in a puddle of blood on
the ground in 5, 4, 3, Come on!, 2

1070
01:26:32,301 --> 01:26:33,252
How did we get this shit?

1071
01:26:33,253 --> 01:26:36,104
Alright, I'm going to give you a chance to
escape, put down your weapons.

1072
01:26:37,104 --> 01:26:40,866
And tie yourselves into those chairs
and I'll let you live. In 5, 4

1073
01:26:43,147 --> 01:26:45,601
You should be gone by now, you
should have already been gone.

1074
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:46,710
I'm just beyond terrified.

1075
01:26:46,711 --> 01:26:48,189
Here it comes.

1076
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:50,193
3, 4

1077
01:26:50,194 --> 01:26:52,193
Shut up. - 54321

1078
01:26:52,992 --> 01:26:54,193
I told you.

1079
01:27:07,161 --> 01:27:08,203
Where's the rest?

1080
01:28:06,775 --> 01:28:10,778
Honestly, I hate working here...
they are so weird.

1081
01:28:15,662 --> 01:28:16,902
Better late than never.

1082
01:28:22,909 --> 01:28:24,669
Not this time. Not the face.

1083
01:28:26,527 --> 01:28:28,823
Phew, it's good to be back. Hello,
by the way.

1084
01:28:28,824 --> 01:28:29,619
Oh, hello sir.

1085
01:28:35,743 --> 01:28:38,056
All personnel, Stark is loose and
somewhere in the compound.

1086
01:28:38,057 --> 01:28:40,065
Repeat: Stark is loose and somewhere
in the compound.

1087
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,881
Ah, crap.

1088
01:28:56,288 --> 01:28:58,849
- Tony.
- Rudy, tell me that was you in the suit.

1089
01:28:58,869 --> 01:29:00,149
No, you got yours?

1090
01:29:00,150 --> 01:29:03,412
Uh, um, kind of. Main house
as fast as you can.

1091
01:29:03,453 --> 01:29:04,733
Somebody I'd like you to meet.

1092
01:29:10,185 --> 01:29:12,206
You, you. Move!
Get out!

1093
01:29:12,207 --> 01:29:14,179
The room is secure. I have eyes
on the Mandarin.

1094
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,689
What's this? I had winner's.

1095
01:29:25,088 --> 01:29:26,295
What've you come as?

1096
01:29:26,296 --> 01:29:28,531
Make a move and I'll break
your face.

1097
01:29:30,011 --> 01:29:33,493
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1098
01:29:34,174 --> 01:29:35,395
This is the Mandarin?

1099
01:29:35,396 --> 01:29:37,255
I know, it's, it's embarrassing.

1100
01:29:37,256 --> 01:29:39,217
Hi, I'm Trevor,
Trevor Slattery.

1101
01:29:39,218 --> 01:29:43,153
I know I'm shorter in person, I'm a bit small,
everyone says that but, uh, hey

1102
01:29:43,154 --> 01:29:46,700
if you're here to arrest me, there are
some people who I'd like to roll on.

1103
01:29:46,701 --> 01:29:47,881
Here's how it works,
Meryl Streep.

1104
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:49,702
You tell him where Pepper
is and he'll stop doing it.

1105
01:29:50,342 --> 01:29:53,664
Doing what? Oh, I get it! Ow!
That hurt! I get it! I get it!

1106
01:29:53,665 --> 01:29:57,587
I do not know about any Pepper,
but I know the plan.

1107
01:29:57,588 --> 01:29:59,749
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1108
01:30:00,108 --> 01:30:03,694
What? No. But I do know what's happening
off the coast.

1109
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:07,472
Something to do with uh... a big boat.
I can take you there.

1110
01:30:11,636 --> 01:30:14,157
Tony, I swear to God, I'm going
to blow his face off.

1111
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:17,678
Oh this next bit may include the
Vice President as well.

1112
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:20,475
- Is that important?
- Somewhat.

1113
01:30:20,476 --> 01:30:21,762
Yeah, a little bit.

1114
01:30:24,947 --> 01:30:26,652
- So?
- Uh, what are we gonna do.

1115
01:30:27,253 --> 01:30:30,470
We don't have any transport.

1116
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:34,895
Hey, Ringo, didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1117
01:30:37,316 --> 01:30:39,765
If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes
from where Pepper is.

1118
01:30:39,766 --> 01:30:41,980
But we also have to figure out this
Vice President thing, right?

1119
01:30:42,461 --> 01:30:45,302
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh, that's the Vice President.

1120
01:30:47,223 --> 01:30:49,743
- Hello.
- Sir, this is Tony Stark.

1121
01:30:50,425 --> 01:30:51,813
Welcome back to the land
of the living.

1122
01:30:51,814 --> 01:30:54,054
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign,

1123
01:30:54,055 --> 01:30:56,189
and we've got to get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1124
01:30:56,268 --> 01:31:00,951
Mr. Stark, I'm about to eat honey roast ham
surrounded by the agency's finest.

1125
01:31:00,952 --> 01:31:04,052
And the President is safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1126
01:31:04,152 --> 01:31:05,614
I think we're good here.

1127
01:31:05,615 --> 01:31:07,554
Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes!

1128
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,573
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a trojan horse.

1129
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:10,536
They're gonna take out

1130
01:31:10,537 --> 01:31:13,198
the President somehow. We have to
immediately alert that plane.

1131
01:31:13,398 --> 01:31:15,899
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security
lock it down. If need be,

1132
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,082
they can have F22s in the air in 30 seconds.
Thank you, Colonel.

1133
01:31:19,180 --> 01:31:20,074
Rhodes and Stark out.

1134
01:31:21,983 --> 01:31:23,300
Everything okay, sir?

1135
01:31:24,802 --> 01:31:26,325
Couldn't be better.

1136
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:35,671
I love you, baby.

1137
01:31:55,062 --> 01:31:58,123
Colonel Rhodes. Glad to see
you could make it, son.

1138
01:31:58,225 --> 01:31:59,306
I feel safer already.

1139
01:32:04,908 --> 01:32:06,189
We gotta make a decision.
We can either save

1140
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:08,190
the President or Pepper.
We can't do both.

1141
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:10,091
Sir, I have an update
from Malibu.

1142
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,297
The cranes have finally
arrived and the

1143
01:32:12,298 --> 01:32:14,394
cellar doors are being
cleared as we speak.

1144
01:32:14,954 --> 01:32:16,375
And what about the suit
I'm wearing?

1145
01:32:16,376 --> 01:32:18,076
The armor is now at 92%.

1146
01:32:19,135 --> 01:32:20,456
That's gonna have to do.

1147
01:32:30,123 --> 01:32:31,852
Oh, here he comes, here he comes,
get a quick picture.

1148
01:32:31,853 --> 01:32:32,284
Sure.

1149
01:32:50,214 --> 01:32:52,137
Is everything all right,
Colonel?

1150
01:33:22,953 --> 01:33:25,516
It is an honor,
Mr. President.

1151
01:33:25,995 --> 01:33:28,337
If you're gonna do it,
do it.

1152
01:33:28,537 --> 01:33:29,930
Woh. Cool your boots, Sir.

1153
01:33:29,931 --> 01:33:31,859
That's not how the
Mandarin works.

1154
01:33:31,929 --> 01:33:34,530
Sir. Air Force One's
been compromised.

1155
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:36,444
Internal shots, temperature
spikes.

1156
01:33:36,445 --> 01:33:37,607
Get me eyes on it now.

1157
01:33:37,608 --> 01:33:39,253
Image coming through
now, Sir.

1158
01:33:41,936 --> 01:33:44,276
Is that Rhodes?

1159
01:34:13,193 --> 01:34:16,193
The President.
Now.

1160
01:34:16,675 --> 01:34:18,156
He's not here.

1161
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:23,643
Try the jet stream.

1162
01:34:25,345 --> 01:34:27,441
Speaking of which,
go fish!

1163
01:34:49,794 --> 01:34:52,235
Walk away from that, you
son of a bitch.

1164
01:35:04,903 --> 01:35:07,545
- How many in the air?
- Thirteen, sir.

1165
01:35:09,006 --> 01:35:10,806
- How many can I carry
- Four, sir.

1166
01:35:20,813 --> 01:35:24,076
Slow down, slow down. Relax, what's
your name? Heather..

1167
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,614
Listen to me, see
that guy?

1168
01:35:34,615 --> 01:35:36,033
I'm gonna swing
by him

1169
01:35:36,034 --> 01:35:37,124
and you're just gonna
grab him.

1170
01:35:37,324 --> 01:35:38,543
You got it?

1171
01:35:40,506 --> 01:35:42,497
I will electrify your arm,

1172
01:35:42,498 --> 01:35:44,266
you won't be able to open
your hand.

1173
01:35:45,692 --> 01:35:46,892
You can do this,
Heather.

1174
01:35:55,713 --> 01:35:58,454
Easy, see? Eleven
more to go.

1175
01:36:01,316 --> 01:36:03,212
Remember that game called
Barrel of Monkeys?

1176
01:36:03,213 --> 01:36:04,519
That's what we're
going to do.

1177
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:05,391
18,000 feet.

1178
01:36:05,992 --> 01:36:07,961
Come on, people! Everybody, grab
your monkey!

1179
01:36:12,642 --> 01:36:15,925
- Nice!
- 10,000 feet.

1180
01:36:19,167 --> 01:36:21,128
- 6,000 feet.
- Come on, people.

1181
01:36:21,969 --> 01:36:23,610
Come on, come on, come on

1182
01:36:27,453 --> 01:36:30,815
- Yeah!
- 1000 feet.

1183
01:36:32,335 --> 01:36:35,080
400 feet. 200 feet,
sir.

1184
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:36,958
It's a tricky monkey,
let's get him.

1185
01:36:37,298 --> 01:36:39,059
Hello.

1186
01:37:01,552 --> 01:37:03,281
Nice work guys.
Excellent.

1187
01:37:03,282 --> 01:37:05,674
Good team effort all around.
Go us.

1188
01:37:06,315 --> 01:37:08,836
Alright, Jarvis, but it's only half done,
we still gotta get Pepp-

1189
01:37:16,841 --> 01:37:19,363
That came out of nowhere.

1190
01:37:20,203 --> 01:37:21,120
Gimme some good
news man.

1191
01:37:21,121 --> 01:37:22,625
- I think they all made it.
- Thank God.

1192
01:37:22,844 --> 01:37:24,684
Yeah, but I missed the President.

1193
01:37:25,086 --> 01:37:26,603
You couldn't save the President
with the suit,

1194
01:37:26,604 --> 01:37:27,927
how are you gonna save Pepper
without it?

1195
01:37:28,768 --> 01:37:30,699
Uh, say Jarvis, is it
that time?

1196
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:32,810
The "house party"
protocol, sir?

1197
01:37:32,811 --> 01:37:33,911
Correct.

1198
01:38:04,806 --> 01:38:06,686
Hi.

1199
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:17,593
You think he's gonna help you...
he won't.

1200
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,153
Having you here is not just
to motivate Tony Stark,

1201
01:38:25,454 --> 01:38:28,520
it's actually more embarrassing
than that.

1202
01:38:29,219 --> 01:38:34,022
- You're here as my, um
- Trophy.

1203
01:38:45,989 --> 01:38:48,109
Good evening, sir.

1204
01:38:52,113 --> 01:38:54,034
Welcome aboard,
Mr. President.

1205
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:06,084
You ever heard of an elephant
graveyard?

1206
01:39:06,085 --> 01:39:10,363
Well, two years ago, the elephant in
the room was this scow.

1207
01:39:13,114 --> 01:39:14,074
This is the Roxxon Norco.

1208
01:39:14,374 --> 01:39:17,777
Of course you remember when she spilled 100
million gallons of crude off Pensacola.

1209
01:39:17,836 --> 01:39:20,398
Thanks to you, not one fat
cat saw a day in court.

1210
01:39:20,978 --> 01:39:22,299
What do you want from me?

1211
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:25,242
Uh, nothing, sir.

1212
01:39:25,281 --> 01:39:28,404
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1213
01:39:28,972 --> 01:39:33,535
You see, I've moved on. I've found myself
a new political patron, and

1214
01:39:33,755 --> 01:39:36,236
At this time tomorrow, he'll
have your job.

1215
01:39:37,937 --> 01:39:39,638
String him up.

1216
01:39:58,209 --> 01:39:59,470
Come on.

1217
01:40:03,932 --> 01:40:05,694
You're not gonna freak out
on me, right?

1218
01:40:05,695 --> 01:40:06,254
I hope not.

1219
01:40:32,349 --> 01:40:33,890
Oh my God.

1220
01:40:35,372 --> 01:40:37,739
He's strung up over the oil tank, they're
gonna light him up, man.

1221
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,793
Viking funeral.

1222
01:40:39,253 --> 01:40:42,015
- Public execution.
- Yeah, death by oil.

1223
01:40:48,297 --> 01:40:51,379
Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.

1224
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:53,728
Okay, that's good.

1225
01:40:53,729 --> 01:40:56,602
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1226
01:40:58,686 --> 01:40:59,772
Is your gun up?

1227
01:41:00,197 --> 01:41:01,691
Yup, what do I do?

1228
01:41:01,692 --> 01:41:04,421
Stay on my six, cover high, and don't
shoot me in the back.

1229
01:41:04,422 --> 01:41:05,794
Six, high, back. Alright.

1230
01:41:15,953 --> 01:41:17,056
You see that? Nailed it.

1231
01:41:17,057 --> 01:41:18,756
Yeah, you really killed
the glass.

1232
01:41:18,757 --> 01:41:19,874
I was aiming for the bulb?

1233
01:41:19,875 --> 01:41:21,337
You can't hit a bulb from
this distance.

1234
01:41:26,039 --> 01:41:28,365
I'm out. Gimme, gimme, you got
an extra magazine?

1235
01:41:28,366 --> 01:41:29,640
They're not universal, Tony.

1236
01:41:29,962 --> 01:41:31,271
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Gimme another one.

1237
01:41:32,134 --> 01:41:33,725
I don't have one that
fits that gun.

1238
01:41:33,905 --> 01:41:34,428
You've got like five of them.

1239
01:41:34,429 --> 01:41:36,586
Alright, here's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna spot. Ready?

1240
01:41:37,587 --> 01:41:38,832
What'd you see?

1241
01:41:38,833 --> 01:41:41,549
Too fast, nothing.
Here we go.

1242
01:41:45,892 --> 01:41:47,853
Three guys, one girl,
all armed.

1243
01:41:57,807 --> 01:41:59,502
God, I'd kill for some
armor right now.

1244
01:41:59,503 --> 01:42:01,409
- You're right, we need backup.
- Yeah, much.

1245
01:42:02,811 --> 01:42:04,710
You know what?

1246
01:42:08,173 --> 01:42:09,734
- Is that?
- Yep.

1247
01:42:11,216 --> 01:42:12,335
- Are those?
- Yeah.

1248
01:42:29,665 --> 01:42:31,106
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1249
01:42:36,269 --> 01:42:38,652
Jarvis, target Extremis heat
signatures.

1250
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:40,440
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1251
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:41,913
Yes, sir.

1252
01:42:46,475 --> 01:42:49,557
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1253
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:51,919
Take 'em to church.

1254
01:43:13,532 --> 01:43:15,552
Jarvis, get Igor to steady
this thing.

1255
01:43:27,819 --> 01:43:29,968
This is how you've been managing
your downtime, huh?

1256
01:43:29,969 --> 01:43:31,021
Everybody needs a hobby.

1257
01:43:37,385 --> 01:43:39,426
Heartbreaker? Help Red Snapper
out, will ya?

1258
01:44:07,684 --> 01:44:08,236
Nice timing.

1259
01:44:08,237 --> 01:44:10,444
Oh yeah, that's awesome. Give me
a suit, okay?

1260
01:44:12,607 --> 01:44:14,407
Oh, I'm sorry. They're
only coded to me.

1261
01:44:14,807 --> 01:44:15,594
What's that mean?

1262
01:44:15,595 --> 01:44:16,568
I got you covered.

1263
01:44:20,290 --> 01:44:23,492
- Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
- Very funny.

1264
01:44:41,303 --> 01:44:43,585
- Sir, I've located Miss Potts.
- About time.

1265
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:59,314
Stop, put it down, put it
down, put it down.

1266
01:45:01,954 --> 01:45:03,956
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1267
01:45:06,837 --> 01:45:07,706
You're such a jerk.

1268
01:45:07,707 --> 01:45:09,319
Yup, we'll talk about
it at dinner.

1269
01:45:11,159 --> 01:45:13,881
Come on, a little more,
baby.

1270
01:45:29,731 --> 01:45:31,172
Is this guy bothering you?

1271
01:45:32,732 --> 01:45:35,455
Don't get up!

1272
01:45:38,456 --> 01:45:40,417
Is it hot there?

1273
01:45:41,778 --> 01:45:43,458
Stuck? Feel a little stuck?

1274
01:45:44,459 --> 01:45:47,741
Like a little turtle, cooking in
his little turtle suit?

1275
01:45:48,341 --> 01:45:49,942
Tony

1276
01:45:49,943 --> 01:45:51,584
She's watching.

1277
01:45:52,785 --> 01:45:54,306
I think you should close
your eyes.

1278
01:45:54,307 --> 01:45:55,306
Close your eyes.

1279
01:45:55,906 --> 01:45:58,868
Close your eyes. You don't
want to see this.

1280
01:46:06,313 --> 01:46:07,833
Yeah, you take a minute.

1281
01:46:40,892 --> 01:46:42,574
Jarvis, give me a suit
right now!

1282
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:55,140
Aw, come on!

1283
01:46:56,541 --> 01:46:59,503
Mr. President! Just hold on,
alright? I'm coming.

1284
01:47:00,784 --> 01:47:03,025
Just hold on.
Hold on.

1285
01:47:24,838 --> 01:47:26,298
Buh-bye.

1286
01:47:38,005 --> 01:47:39,767
Brace yourself!

1287
01:47:50,253 --> 01:47:53,935
You look damn good, Mr. President, but
I'm gonna need that suit back.

1288
01:48:07,023 --> 01:48:09,104
The President is secure, Tony.
I'm clearing the area.

1289
01:48:09,105 --> 01:48:10,119
Nice work.

1290
01:48:10,621 --> 01:48:12,465
- Ready sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1291
01:48:21,432 --> 01:48:25,672
Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you.
Just look at me.

1292
01:48:27,554 --> 01:48:30,152
Honey, I can't reach any further, and
you can't stay there, alright?

1293
01:48:30,153 --> 01:48:31,177
You gotta let go.

1294
01:48:31,276 --> 01:48:34,079
You gotta let go. I'll catch
you, I promise.

1295
01:49:04,576 --> 01:49:08,459
What a shame, I would
have caught her.

1296
01:49:38,769 --> 01:49:39,870
Eject.

1297
01:50:25,544 --> 01:50:27,985
Well here we are,
on the roof.

1298
01:50:38,351 --> 01:50:40,152
- Mark 42 inbound.
- Well I'll be damned.

1299
01:50:40,952 --> 01:50:42,513
The prodigal son returns.

1300
01:50:58,683 --> 01:50:59,843
Whatever.

1301
01:51:00,844 --> 01:51:02,724
You really didn't deserve
her, Tony.

1302
01:51:03,967 --> 01:51:07,728
It's a pity. I was so close to having
her... perfect.

1303
01:51:10,590 --> 01:51:12,816
Okay, okay, wait, wait, slow down,
slow down.

1304
01:51:13,117 --> 01:51:15,052
You're right. I don't
deserve her.

1305
01:51:16,333 --> 01:51:17,854
But here's where
you're wrong.

1306
01:51:18,574 --> 01:51:20,936
She was already perfect.

1307
01:51:27,499 --> 01:51:31,921
Jarvis, do me a favor and
blow Mark 42.

1308
01:51:32,044 --> 01:51:35,958
NOOOO!!

1309
01:52:47,386 --> 01:52:49,346
No more false faces.

1310
01:52:49,928 --> 01:52:52,327
You said you wanted
the Mandarin.

1311
01:52:52,928 --> 01:52:55,031
You're looking right
at him.

1312
01:52:56,032 --> 01:52:59,470
It was always me, Tony, right
from the start.

1313
01:52:59,671 --> 01:53:01,214
I am the Mandarin!

1314
01:53:12,681 --> 01:53:14,402
I got nothing.

1315
01:53:20,245 --> 01:53:23,407
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1316
01:53:31,972 --> 01:53:34,013
What? Oh what, are
you mad at me?

1317
01:53:59,388 --> 01:54:00,649
Honey.

1318
01:54:05,312 --> 01:54:06,572
Oh my God.

1319
01:54:07,973 --> 01:54:10,455
I was really violent.

1320
01:54:11,215 --> 01:54:13,750
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were

1321
01:54:13,751 --> 01:54:16,158
I was dead. Why? Because I
fell two hundred feet?

1322
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:22,863
- Who's the hot mess now?
- Still debatable.

1323
01:54:23,923 --> 01:54:25,092
Probably tipping your way
a little bit.

1324
01:54:25,093 --> 01:54:26,204
Why don't you dress like
this at home?

1325
01:54:26,765 --> 01:54:28,765
Hmm? Sports bra, the
whole deal.

1326
01:54:29,106 --> 01:54:32,307
You know I think I understand why you
don't want to give up the suits.

1327
01:54:32,889 --> 01:54:34,849
What I am gonna complain
about now?

1328
01:54:36,209 --> 01:54:39,691
Well, it's me. I'll think
of something.

1329
01:54:41,293 --> 01:54:44,334
- Don't touch me. No, I'm gonna burn you!
- No, no.

1330
01:54:45,476 --> 01:54:47,076
You're not hot.

1331
01:54:48,096 --> 01:54:49,778
Am I gonna be okay?

1332
01:54:49,779 --> 01:54:52,940
No, you're in a relationship with me,
everything will never be okay.

1333
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:55,781
But I think I can figure
this out, yeah.

1334
01:54:55,782 --> 01:55:00,265
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was
drunk. I think I can get you better.

1335
01:55:01,423 --> 01:55:03,025
That's what I do.
I fix things.

1336
01:55:04,266 --> 01:55:06,467
And all your distractions?

1337
01:55:06,868 --> 01:55:09,109
Uh, I'm gonna shave them
down a little bit.

1338
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:12,656
- Jarvis, hey.
- All wrapped up here, sir.

1339
01:55:12,657 --> 01:55:15,112
Will there be anything else?

1340
01:55:15,113 --> 01:55:16,113
You know what to do.

1341
01:55:16,813 --> 01:55:19,595
The "clean slate" protocol,
sir?

1342
01:55:19,596 --> 01:55:22,897
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1343
01:55:59,538 --> 01:56:01,640
Okay so far?
You like it?

1344
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:05,222
It'll do.

1345
01:56:13,186 --> 01:56:18,109
And so, as Christmas morning began, my
journey had reached its end.

1346
01:56:22,512 --> 01:56:26,794
You start with something pure,
something exciting.

1347
01:56:27,475 --> 01:56:30,236
Then come the mistakes.

1348
01:56:30,997 --> 01:56:32,918
The compromises.

1349
01:56:39,201 --> 01:56:41,563
"We create our own Demons".

1350
01:56:47,127 --> 01:56:49,527
- It's great to see you.
- Oh, pleasure.

1351
01:56:50,527 --> 01:56:53,827
As promised, I've got Pepper 
sorted out, took some tinkering.

1352
01:56:54,527 --> 01:56:57,827
But then I thought to myself, 
why stop there?

1353
01:57:02,477 --> 01:57:05,180
Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous.

1354
01:57:05,679 --> 01:57:09,081
But I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live
with a chest full of shrapnel.

1355
01:57:09,642 --> 01:57:12,544
And now... neither will I.

1356
01:57:13,563 --> 01:57:17,325
Let me tell you, that was the best
sleep I'd had in years.

1357
01:57:38,349 --> 01:57:42,111
- It's okay, it's okay.
- No!

1358
01:58:59,878 --> 01:59:03,400
So if I were to wrap this up tight
with a bow or whatever.

1359
01:59:03,558 --> 01:59:09,983
I guess I'd say my armor was never
a distraction or a hobby.

1360
01:59:10,504 --> 01:59:12,424
It was a cocoon.

1361
01:59:13,445 --> 01:59:18,447
And now, I'm a
changed man.

1362
01:59:27,494 --> 01:59:29,674
You can take away
my house,

1363
01:59:30,074 --> 01:59:31,514
All my tricks and toys.

1364
01:59:32,095 --> 01:59:34,298
One thing you can't take away...

1365
01:59:37,459 --> 01:59:39,561
I am Iron Man.

1366
02:09:05,554 --> 02:09:07,856
You know, and thank you, by
the way, for listening.

1367
02:09:07,857 --> 02:09:10,845
There's just something about getting
it off my chest and putting

1368
02:09:10,846 --> 02:09:13,559
it out there in the atmosphere
instead of holding this in.

1369
02:09:13,889 --> 02:09:16,791
I mean, this is what gets people
sick, you know?

1370
02:09:16,991 --> 02:09:19,893
Wow, I had no idea you were
such a good listener.

1371
02:09:19,993 --> 02:09:23,603
To be able to share all of my intimate
thoughts and my experiences

1372
02:09:23,604 --> 02:09:26,897
with someone, it just cuts the weight
of it in half, you know.

1373
02:09:26,898 --> 02:09:28,252
It's like a snake swallowing
its own tail.

1374
02:09:28,354 --> 02:09:29,298
Everything comes full circle.

1375
02:09:29,798 --> 02:09:32,700
And...and the fact that you've been
able to help me process-

1376
02:09:35,272 --> 02:09:36,672
- So, uh...?
- You with me?

1377
02:09:36,673 --> 02:09:38,874
I was, yeah. Mm-hmm. We were...
uh, we were at, uh...

1378
02:09:38,875 --> 02:09:40,274
You actively napping?

1379
02:09:40,275 --> 02:09:42,676
I...I was...I... I...
I drifted.

1380
02:09:42,976 --> 02:09:44,277
Where did I lose you?

1381
02:09:46,078 --> 02:09:48,379
Elevator in Switzerland.

1382
02:09:49,180 --> 02:09:50,480
So you heard none of it?

1383
02:09:50,981 --> 02:09:54,203
I'm sorry, I'm not that
kind of doctor.

1384
02:09:54,204 --> 02:09:56,884
I'm not a therapist, it's not
my training.

1385
02:09:56,885 --> 02:09:58,285
- So?
- I don't have the...

1386
02:09:58,385 --> 02:10:00,987
- What? The time?
- Temperament.

1387
02:10:01,087 --> 02:10:03,122
You know what? Now that I
think about it,

1388
02:10:03,123 --> 02:10:06,690
Oh God my original wound.
1983, alright?

1389
02:10:06,691 --> 02:10:07,390
Yes.

1390
02:10:07,391 --> 02:10:10,092
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny?
That was weird.

1391
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:14,070
