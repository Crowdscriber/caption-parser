159
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:19,714
Look at it.
A bit much.

160
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,257
I don't think
it is a bit much.

161
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,550
I think it's right
on the money.

162
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:24,177
What is he,
Pablo Escobar?

163
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,511
Come on, man, this is
an awesome street.

164
00:06:25,595 --> 00:06:27,263
Channing Tatum
lives up there.

165
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,140
Oh, for the love of... Will
you stop talking about...

166
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,308
This is the sexiest
street in America.

167
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:31,517
You and
Channing Tatum.

168
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,894
I think
he's attractive.

169
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,147
I think it's a cool house.
I know you do.

170
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,774
I can't wait
to see inside it.

171
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:39,442
That's why I'm excited.

172
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:43,237
Ha-ha! Yes!
What's up, man? Seth!

173
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:45,239
So happy you're here.
I'm so happy to be here.

174
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:46,574
Hey, Johnny,
what's up?

175
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,076
It's Jay.
It's Jay.

176
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,536
LWlnever forget it again, man.
Good to see you.

177
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,330
Nice to see you. Come on in.
Yeah! Yeah, great.

178
00:06:52,413 --> 00:06:54,624
JAMES: Check it out.
My new place!

179
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,459
SETH: Awesome, man!

180
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,668
Designed it myself.

181
00:06:57,752 --> 00:07:00,505
Really cool. This place
is beautiful, man.

182
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,590
This place is
like a piece of me.

183
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,759
You two just
stepped inside me.

184
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:07,929
You let us both
cum inside you. Yeah.

185
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:10,723
Icing on the cake.
Check it out.

186
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:12,517
Painted them myself.

187
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:13,935
Huh.

188
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,937
Side by side.
A team.

189
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,021
(LAUGHS) Holy shit.

190
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,232
So, is it weird?

191
00:07:19,315 --> 00:07:21,275
No.
You sure?

192
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,027
I really like it.

193
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,237
What do you think, Jay?

194
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,447
I'm not a big art guy.

195
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,782
You don't like art?

196
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:29,742
Well, come on...

197
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:31,744
You play video games?
Yes.

198
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:33,871
Well, guess what, buddy?
You like art.

199
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:34,956
Yep.

200
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,165
You ever been
to Subway?

201
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,291
Yes.

202
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,751
You order a sandwich?

203
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:40,962
Somebody put that together for you, dude.
That's art.

204
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:42,130
Sandwich artist.

205
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:43,422
So, let me
lay this on you, Jay.

206
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:44,507
Oh, fuck.

207
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,800
Your mama's pussy
was the canvas.

208
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,635
Your dad's dick
was the paintbrush.

209
00:07:47,718 --> 00:07:49,720
Boom.
You're the art. Huh?

210
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:52,223
Thanks, James Franco.
You got it.

211
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,808
Seth!
Mindy, hello.

212
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,476
Oh, my God, great to see you.
Oh, you, too.

213
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,811
Long time.
How's it going?

214
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,147
You know Jay? I don't think
I've ever actually met you.

215
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,898
<i>You were so good in
Million Dollar Baby.</i>

216
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:02,984
That's amazing. Thank you
so much for saying that.

217
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,986
Oh, my God, if I don't
fuck Michael Cera tonight,

218
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,071
I'm gonna blow my brains out.
What?

219
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,365
Fucking pale, 110 pounds,

220
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,910
hairless, probably has a huge
cock, coked out of his mind...

221
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:15,246
You can do a lot better.
That's just trouble.

222
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,875
So, Ri-Ri, how about you,
you ever see a psychiatrist?

223
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,168
Um...

224
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,504
(GRUNTS)

225
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:25,256
JASON: That's not cool.
Don't touch my butt, bitch.

226
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,425
Michael, that's not cool. Would
you shut the fuck up, Jason!

227
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,385
We're playing
a game, man.

228
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,637
Say cheese, baby.

229
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,432
What's up, buddy?
How's it going, dude?

230
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,725
Good to see you, man.

231
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,351
Is that Jay Baruchel?
Hi, there. Hey.

232
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:38,519
Oh, my God,
get in here, dude.

233
00:08:38,603 --> 00:08:40,188
How's it going, Jonah?
What are you doing?

234
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,523
Good. How you doing, buddy?
Oh, my gosh.

235
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,650
Welcome back.
Thank you very much.

236
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,611
When'd you get in?
Uh, this morning,

237
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,529
and boy,
are my arms tired.

238
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,031
(LAUGHS)

239
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:51,324
Dude, that's great.

240
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,408
Thank you.
JONAH: Sick.

241
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,993
What have you guys
been doing?

242
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,912
Oh, we just
hung out all day.

243
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:59,916
Ate a bunch of dirty burgers, and
smoked about a fucking pound of weed

244
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:01,417
and played
a bunch of video games.

245
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,711
Weed is tight. Weed is tight.
That's awesome.

246
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,004
That's awesome.
Weed is awesome.

247
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,423
It was like the golfing
sequence in Navy <i>SEALs.</i>

248
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,550
Sick reference, though, bro.
Oh, thanks, bud.

249
00:09:09,634 --> 00:09:11,802
Dude, your references are out of control.
Everyone knows that.

250
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,471
Hey, thanks, man.
I'm jealous.

251
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,848
I would have been there
in a heartbeat,

252
00:09:15,932 --> 00:09:19,227
but, uh, I actually just adopted
this incontinent spaniel.

253
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,394
She's a really
beautiful soul.

254
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,104
Her name's Ahjhai.
Ahjhai?

255
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,231
Yeah.
How do you spell it?

256
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:24,857
A-H-J-H-A-I.

257
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:26,067
A-H...

258
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,109
You want to see
a picture of her?

259
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:29,237
Oh, she's so sweet.
Hey!

260
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,571
Look at her.
SETH: Aw!

261
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,323
She can't bark. She
doesn't know how, so...

262
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:33,491
She doesn't know
how to bark, even?

263
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,575
She doesn't know
how to bark,

264
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,244
so I've tried
to teach her

265
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:38,496
and she just kind of
screams, and so she was up,

266
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,249
had her face smushed against
the cage, and was, like...

267
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:42,541
(YELLING) Ah!

268
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:44,835
Yeah, cool. Um...

269
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:47,797
Tell you what, boys,
I'm kind ofjonesing,

270
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,259
so I'm gonna find someone loan bum
a smoke off of outside, all right?

271
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:53,094
That's tight, dude.
Honestly, I like you.

272
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:54,178
Hey, likewise.

273
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:55,680
SETH:
Okay, dude, come back.

274
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,599
I'll be right back. You're holding court.
All right, boys.

275
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,894
Dude. I know. I think we're
making some progress.

276
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:02,937
That was really good.

277
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,313
And honestly,
he's your old friend.

278
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:05,773
We're your new friends.
He feels threatened.

279
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,857
Yeah, man.

280
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,609
You know,
and I get it.

281
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:09,652
It's gonna be fine.

282
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,070
I honestly think
tonight's the night

283
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,321
we bust
this whole thing open.

284
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:15,574
And I'm lucky. It's the
same thing a lot, though.

285
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,285
It's, like, my TV wife
opensthefﬂdge,

286
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:20,204
andis,Hke, "What happened
to the birthday cake?"

287
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:22,957
And I come outwith, like,
a little frosting, like,

288
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,375
(GOOFY VOICE)
"What birthday cake?"

289
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:26,043
'Cause you ate the cake! Yeah.

290
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,336
'Cause you ate the cake!

291
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,629
"It's my birthday."

292
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,381
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

293
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:33,050
That's why y'all number one.
'Cause of that.

294
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,427
You're Jay, right?
Yeah.

295
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,511
Seth's boy?
Yeah.

296
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,887
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.

297
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,055
Good.
Likewise, likewise.

298
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,099
I'm Craig, man. This is Emma.
Hi. Hi, there.

299
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,809
You just in town
visiting him, or what?

300
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,021
Yeah. Just for a little
visit, you know.

301
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,106
I try to not come
down here very much.

302
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,482
I don't really
love it here.

303
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,525
You don't like LA?

304
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:53,404
I'm just not really
into the LA lifestyle.

305
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,197
What lifestyle
are you into?

306
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:57,783
Look at him. He's, like,
a hipster, right?

307
00:10:57,867 --> 00:11:00,453
No, I'm not
a hipster, at all.

308
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:03,122
Yeah, yeah, you do seem
to hate a lot of things,

309
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,874
and the bottom of your
pants are awful tight.

310
00:11:04,957 --> 00:11:08,794
No, I just... I don't like Los Angeles.
It doesn't make me a hipster.

311
00:11:08,878 --> 00:11:11,130
I'll bet you hate movies
that are universally loved.

312
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,214
I don't even...

00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,443
(SOBBING) You did your best, man.
I love you.

625
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:23,820
Why the fuck did you
guys run out there?

626
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,447
You know what, James,
can you lower your voice?

627
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,740
You're freaking out Jay!

628
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,658
Maybe I'm a little
freaked out, too!

629
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:30,285
He's not as strong as you.
JAY: They all fell in.

630
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,537
JAMES: Look at my house! JAY: I tried
to save them. They all fell in.

631

(JONAH SHUSHING) Get your fucking hands off me.
Jonah, stop touching me.

632
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:36,875
Can we get Jay
some water, please?

633
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,168
Can we get him
some hydration?

634
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:39,669
He needs to be hydrated. SETH:
The water's not working!

635
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,254
Everyone just
runs out the door!

636
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,589
My phone is dead.

637
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:44,341
Guys, the fucking
lnternet's not working!

638
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,301
Let's watch the TV.
Let's check the news.

639
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:48,178
JAY:
Where is the TV?

640
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,263
It's in the floor.
In the floor?

641
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:52,099
CRAIG: Oh, that's dope.
JAMES: Yeah, cool, huh?

642
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,183
That's really neat.

643
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,684
That is impressive, James.

644

Shit. It's gone, guys.

654
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:19,459
(STAMMERS)
So I think we should...

655
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,629
I think we should probably
go back to your place, eh?

656
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:24,131
What are you
talking about, man?

657
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:27,384
No, no way.
I'm not leaving here.

658
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:30,846
I don't want to die
at James Franco's house.

659
00:24:31,346 --> 00:24:32,806
SETH: You heard the TV.

660
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,560
The TV said stay here.
It said stay in your homes.

661
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,729
We need to stay here until they
start rescuing people, okay?

662
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,315
A huge earthquake happens.
Who do they rescue first?

663
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,817
Actors.
SETH: Famous people.

664
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,361
They'll get Clooney,
Sandra Bullock, me.

665
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:48,196
If there's room,
you guys'll come.

666
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,407
The point is, is that we're all

crazy out there, guys.

670
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,330
We can't leave. I'm not leaving, okay?
I'm a victim.

671
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,250
I've had a victim's mentality my whole life.
People can smell it on me.

they tittie-fucked me.

769

doesn't mean we can't
have some fun.

Can I have that
Milky Way?

No, you can't have
the Milky Way.

this morning,

777

Way to eat after my party.

up on that, Seth.

the whole Milky Way.

least get a bite of the Milky Way.

Oh! Now Craig wants
a bite of the Milky Way.

Yeah, I want a bite of the Milky Way.
It's a fucking Milky Way.

What?

1231
00:46:36,545 --> 00:46:39,882
This is one girl
in a house with six males.

1232
00:46:39,965 --> 00:46:41,133
Yeah. Really safe.

1234
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:43,469
She's like
a little sister.

1235
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:45,012
I think that
she needs...

1236
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,805
It's important
that she feels safe.

1237
00:46:46,889 --> 00:46:48,348
Yeah.
And comfortable.

1238
00:46:48,432 --> 00:46:49,808
And we should
be mindful.

1239
00:46:49,892 --> 00:46:51,185
Who's making her
not feel safe?

1240
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:52,728
Well, I'm just saying,
we should...

1241
00:46:52,811 --> 00:46:55,147
We don't want to
give off a bad vibe.

1242
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,773
Vibe? Vibes? I ain't
giving no vibes.

1243
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:58,484
Yeah, wait, what kind of vibes
are you talking about, man?

1244
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,444
He's talking about us

JONAH: Whoa! What?

1247
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:05,282
Chill out, dude.

1248
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:07,242
Why you putting that
shit in the mix? Yeah.

1249
00:47:07,326 --> 00:47:09,077

You're the one saying it.

1250
00:47:09,161 --> 00:47:10,579
No one here is thinking
about raping anyone.

1251
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,289
Shh! Well, you
talking about vibes

1252
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:15,209
is the only thing that's
rapey going on right now.

1253
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:17,211
Dude, nothing was rapey till you
brought up the rapey vibes.

1254
00:47:17,294 --> 00:47:19,296

00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,262
Jay couldn't rape a fly.

entire conversation right now.

1262

If anyone's gonna
rape anyone here,

1263

it's probably
gonna be Danny.

What?

1265

Why do you think
I'm gonna rape somebody?

1266
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:39,149
I'm just trying
to lay it out there.

1267

I'm not gonna
rape anyone, all right?

1268
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:41,944
If anyone's gonna
rape somebody, it's Jay.

up with the rape idea.

like the police sketch

have the rope anymore!

We fucking dropped it!
We're sorry!

the fuck that was,

going back out there.

Craig, you didn't even
get any of the water.

It's so close,
but so far.

The water, it's, like,
right underneath us.

Like, right there.

1418

What do you mean
"right underneath us"?

1419

like, right there.

Danny and Jonah's shift ends in ten

1423
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:41,177
Okay.

1424
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:42,637
Let me ask you something.

1425
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,641
You really think this is

1426
00:53:46,725 --> 00:53:48,184
the Apocalypse?

1427
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:50,770
You saw something
out there, didn't you?

1428
00:53:50,854 --> 00:53:56,276
All right, let's just say for
sake of argument, what if I did?

1429
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,486
What if this is the real
shit, right now, happening?

1430
00:53:59,487 --> 00:54:01,948
What if it is, man? We're
not prepared for this.

1431
00:54:02,073 --> 00:54:03,992
What do we do? What's next?
It says in the Bible,

1432
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,994
"The worthy will
ascend to Heaven."

1433
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:11,291
Even if it is the Apocalypse,
it's not the end of us.

1434
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:12,918
There's still hope.

1435
00:54:13,001 --> 00:54:16,254
We just have to somehow try
to prove our worthiness.

CRAIG: Okay, so,
you mean, like,

1437
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:22,135
like the Ten Commandments,
like, do shit unto people

1438
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:23,428
that'll do
the same shit to you.

place to start.

to just overall love.

1441

Just be nicer and follow
those commandments.

get through this.

through this, man.

gonna do it together.

you talking about?

1451
00:54:58,672 --> 00:55:01,299

of this nice magazine

1452
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:03,301
I was nice enough
to tell you about.

1453
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:05,053
Was it you, Seth?

1454
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,262
No.

No?
It was me, Franco.

1456

in your magazine.

1457

When I fucking jack off

1458
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:13,645
long enough,
I end upjizzing, dude.

00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:16,272

shit works for you?

don't you fucking aim, huh?

It just goes everywhere.

It's like a fucking
wild fireman's hose.

1463

You just got to grab on
and pray to God

1464

eyes or your mouth.

What, you never had
any brothers?

1467
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:32,747
You didn't learn to jizz in a fucking
sock or on a fucking tissue?

1468
00:55:32,831 --> 00:55:34,582
No, I don't have
any brothers.

1469
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:36,126
I was raised
in a house of women!

1470
00:55:36,209 --> 00:55:37,961
I highly doubt
they fucking taught you

1471

to fucking close your eyes and
fucking cum wherever you want!

thing ljerked off in here?

1480
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,316
I've been dropping loads
around this fucking house

1481
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,609

cum on my stuff!

shoot it off!

enough bullets, bitch.

bitter irony is

quenched until I finish this.

already walked away too much.

1510
00:56:57,582 --> 00:56:59,334
No, you haven't. You
could still come back

1511
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:01,961
and just fucking turn around
and come back and help me.

1512
00:57:03,963 --> 00:57:05,173

1513
00:57:05,882 --> 00:57:07,092
Daniel?

1514
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,685
Need a hand?

1515
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:19,562
Yeah, dude.

1516
00:57:19,646 --> 00:57:20,605
Your shift
just ended, man.

1517
00:57:20,688 --> 00:57:22,065
You don't have to help me
if you don't want to.

1518
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:23,316
It's fine, I get it.

1519
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,151
The fuck else
am I doing?

1520
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:27,362
I appreciate it, man.
Thank you.

1521
00:57:27,445 --> 00:57:28,863
Done and done.
That's cool.

1522
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:37,747
I don't know why I'm thinking
of this, but remember that time

1523
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:41,626
that I got you a fucking
Taco Bell gift certificate

1524
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,419
for, like, 20 bucks,
and I bet you

1525
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,463
that you couldn't eat
all of that in one sitting.

1526
00:57:45,547 --> 00:57:47,340
I do remember that.
I remember thinking,

1527
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:48,633
"How much food
could 20 dollars

1528
00:57:48,716 --> 00:57:50,093
"possibly buy you
at Taco Bell?"

1529
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:51,594
And the answer is infinite.

1530
00:57:51,678 --> 00:57:53,680
And we went to see
fucking Gladiator.

1531
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:54,806
Yeah.

1532
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:57,308
And you sharted midway
through the movie.

1533
00:57:57,392 --> 00:57:59,060
I did. Due to the
tigers' appearance.

1534
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:00,687
I got scared of the tigers.
Yeah.

1535
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:02,230
Literally, when the second
tiger came out, I went...

1536
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:03,690

00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:05,066

You guys Okay?

1543
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,287
I broke my ass in half. Here.

1544
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:18,872
Shit, they got through!

1545
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:21,166
You guys fucking did it.
Oh, my God.

1546
00:58:21,249 --> 00:58:22,250
Fuck. Did that hurt?

1547
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:23,585
SETH: Oh, yes,
it fucking hurt.

1548
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,670
Iloosened this up for
you, I'll have you know.

1549
00:58:25,753 --> 00:58:27,547
Okay, just shut up. It's
fucking dark down here.

1550
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,091
Hold on, hold on.

1551
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,051
Nice.

1552
00:58:32,177 --> 00:58:34,095
Okay, good. Thank you.
What is that?

1553
00:58:34,179 --> 00:58:36,848
That's Terrence Peterson. My
monkey flashlight keychain.

1554
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:38,641
Monkey flashlight keychain?
Mmm-hmm.

1555
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:40,268
What's his name?
Terrence Peterson.

1556
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:41,769
You see it, Seth?
No. Where...

1557
00:58:41,853 --> 00:58:43,146
Are you sure
it's even down here?

1558
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:44,272
Terry Pete.

1559
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,690
Uh, not sure.

1560
00:58:45,773 --> 00:58:47,066
JAY: ls there, is there
any weird shit down here?

1561
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:50,028
Nah, it's where I keep all
my stuff from my old movies.

Fuck, man.

1593
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,759
I'm just pouring myself
another glass of water

1594
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,803
to wash down that dry-ass
Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

but you can't just

pour yourself another
glass of water, man!

Will you cut it out?

1598
01:00:01,099 --> 01:00:03,351
Yeah. We agreed to
one glass at dinner,

1599
01:00:03,434 --> 01:00:04,602
we voted on it, man.

1600
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:05,937
Well, man, I'm just
getting sick and tired

1601
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,355
of all these
fucking rules, man.

1602

rules on you guys.

another glass of water.

less than me.

Why the fuck is it fair

1606
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:17,323
that him and I should drink
the same amount of water?

1607
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:19,117
We should be
dividing our rations

proportionate size.

should split
everything equally.

you'd be more hydrated.

let's get rid of him.

1634
01:01:20,136 --> 01:01:21,429
SETH: What?
What do you mean?

1635
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:23,056
Like, kick him
out of the house?

1636
01:01:23,139 --> 01:01:25,892
His fucking reckless behavior
is dragging us all down.

1637
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:27,977
I mean, he wasted
our water twice.

1638

Two times. Two times.

1639

Dan is under a lot
of pressure. Okay?

1640
01:01:32,607 --> 01:01:34,359
And he's not handling it as
good as the rest of us are.

1641
01:01:34,442 --> 01:01:37,153
Look at him. He's wearing
my fucking tuxedo.

1642
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:38,821
He's been eating nonstop.

1643
01:01:38,905 --> 01:01:41,282
The fucker's gained weight
since he got here.

1644
01:01:41,366 --> 01:01:43,368
The fucker's got to go.

1645
01:01:43,451 --> 01:01:44,452
Go.

1646
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,120

you guys breakfast.

our food when you did that.

something nice for you guys.

behavior at the party.

I know why you guys don't fucking
call me or hang out with me anymore.

1657
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:17,985
It's because I party
so fucking hard.

1658
01:02:18,444 --> 01:02:21,489
Always have.
Ever since I was a baby.

1659
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:23,282
I wouldn't just suck
on my mama's titties.

1660
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:26,494
I would fucking bang 'em
and motorboat 'em.

1661
01:02:27,662 --> 01:02:31,207
Everything I've been doing
has just been a cry for help.

1662
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,085
When I came on
your magazine, James,

1663
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,129
it was a cum for help.

1664
01:02:36,212 --> 01:02:40,007
I've just been crying and
c:omin' and crying and c:omin',

1665
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:42,927
tears from the tip
of my penis, dudes.

1666
01:02:44,262 --> 01:02:45,972
I'm sorry, all right? You
can cum wherever you want.

1667
01:02:46,055 --> 01:02:48,474
I don't even care about
cumming anymore.

1668
01:02:50,017 --> 01:02:52,437
Right now, I'm just
kind of into going.

Danny.

1670
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:56,441
Hey.
Come on, man.

1671
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:58,025
I fucked up.

1672
01:02:58,109 --> 01:02:59,360
I'm sorry, man.
Come on, look,

1673
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:01,154
I was wrong. SETH: I
feel like shit, man.

1674
01:03:01,237 --> 01:03:02,738
I didn't want it
to happen like this.

1675
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:03,906
Let's just discuss it
some more, okay?

1676
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:05,283
Yeah. Let's just
talk, dude.

1677
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:08,035
We're giving you an option.
It's a choice, man.

1678
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:09,954
There's nothing to
figure out, all right?

1679
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:12,707
You guys have said enough, and
there's no going back anymore.

1680
01:03:13,875 --> 01:03:16,878
I don't know if there maybe is, like,
something you guys could give me

1681
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:19,547
so I could at least have some sort
of protection while I'm out there.

1682
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,966
Danny, you don't
have to do this.

1683
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:23,426
SETH: Yeah, man.
JAMES: All right,

1684
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:24,719
if you're really leaving

1685
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:28,139
then you should
take this.

1686
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:29,891
Really?

1687
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:32,268
You don't know
what's out there.

1688
01:03:35,605 --> 01:03:37,273
Thank you, James.

1689

JAMES: Oh, shit.
Don't move.

2007
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:22,908
Oh, shit, he's coming right this way.
Oh, shit.

2008

SETH: Fuck!

2013
01:18:38,965 --> 01:18:39,966
You Okay?

2014
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,218
Come on!

2015
01:18:41,301 --> 01:18:45,305

(SCREAMING)

2018
01:18:49,726 --> 01:18:51,144
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

2019
01:18:51,228 --> 01:18:52,729
There's a fuckin'
demon chasing us!

2020
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:54,398
A demon?
Demon?

2021
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:57,317
What the fuck happened to you guys?
That!

2022
01:18:57,401 --> 01:18:58,819
It's Jonah!
He's possessed!

2023
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:00,153
He's crazy!

2024
01:19:01,113 --> 01:19:03,490
Oh, fuck!
You brained him.

2025
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,283
Is that... I was supposed
to do that, right?

2026

bad news
when he wakes up!

2033
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,840
He's fuckin' strong.

2034
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:21,591
My side's good.
Oh, shit!

2035
01:19:21,675 --> 01:19:23,260
All right,
<i>I'll</i> fuckin' hit him.

2036
01:19:23,343 --> 01:19:24,928
Fuck! Come on, come on! Okay!

2037
01:19:30,350 --> 01:19:32,811
This shit's
cray cray, guys.

2038
01:19:33,103 --> 01:19:36,064
I mean, it's, like,
the real, like Apocalypse.

2039
01:19:36,148 --> 01:19:38,483
It's, like,
the Book of Revelations,

2040
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:40,735
like that means
there's a God.

2041
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,112
Right?

2042
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:44,865
I haven't led my life as though
there's a God this whole time.

2043
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:47,451
Who fuckin' saw that coming?
That there's actually a God?

2044
01:19:47,534 --> 01:19:50,829
I'd say 95%
of the planet.

2045
01:19:52,372 --> 01:19:54,499
Jesus fucking Christ, man.

2046
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:56,626
You might want to stay
away from saying that.

2047
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:59,171
"Jesus fucking Christ"?
Why?

2048
01:19:59,296 --> 01:20:00,964
Why can't I say that? One
of the Ten Commandments.

2049
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:03,884
"Thou shall not take the name
of the Lord thy God in vain."

2050
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,385
Jesus isn't the name
of the Lord.

2051
01:20:05,469 --> 01:20:06,678
God is name
of the Lord.

2052
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:08,805
Jesus, God,
it's all the same.

2053
01:20:08,889 --> 01:20:11,183
It's the Trinity.
Father, Son, Holy Ghost.

2054
01:20:11,266 --> 01:20:13,143
It's like Neapolitan
ice cream.

2055
01:20:13,226 --> 01:20:14,853
I don't even know what
the fucking Commandments are.

2056
01:20:14,936 --> 01:20:19,065
Guys, I think this is sort of bullshit,
because we're all good people.

2057
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:22,319
I can look at each one of you
in the eye, I know you're good.

2058
01:20:22,402 --> 01:20:24,029
I'm good.
We're four actors.

2059
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:26,072
We bring joy
to people's lives.

2060
01:20:26,156 --> 01:20:27,866
Yeah, but we don't
do it for free.

2061
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:32,162
We get paid handsomely, much higher
than the average profession.

2062
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:33,997
It's not like it was just
handed to any of us.

2063
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:35,707
We've worked really
hard to be here.

2064
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:37,918
Yeah, pretend like
it's hot when it's cold.

2065
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:40,587
You sitting on the beach,
it's freezing,

2066

you in your drawers, talking about
something, everybody's surfing.

2067
01:20:44,841 --> 01:20:47,052
(WHISPERS) I think God
might have just fucked up,

2068
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:50,180
made a mistake, and left
us behind by accident.

2069
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,224
I mean, He's got a lot
of shit on His plate.

2070
01:20:52,307 --> 01:20:55,393
It's not an oversight,
it's not a mistake, okay?

2071
01:20:55,477 --> 01:20:59,648
We got to face facts. We're here, and
there's a reason we're all here.

2072
01:20:59,731 --> 01:21:02,025
Why are you so sure?

2073
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:04,194
I've done things, man. I...

2074
01:21:07,322 --> 01:21:09,074
I gouged a man's
eyeballs out.

2075
01:21:09,157 --> 01:21:10,909
What the...
Fuck off.

2076
01:21:10,992 --> 01:21:12,744
Craig.
Well, I was a kid, man.

2077
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:15,038
It was a fuckin' bar fight.

2078
01:21:15,121 --> 01:21:16,456
It was a bad
foosball game.

2079
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:19,209
He said I didn't call spinneys,
and I fuckin' called spinneys.

2080
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:22,128
He got all in my face, and I smashed
a bottle across his face...

2081
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:24,714
(EXHALES DEEPLY) ...and the
first eyeball was an accident,

2082
01:21:24,798 --> 01:21:27,425
but then I was, like, fuck it,
and I went for the second one.

2083
01:21:27,509 --> 01:21:29,553
It was fucked up.
But you know what?

2084
01:21:29,636 --> 01:21:34,099
That shit happens. I'm saying, that's...
I think that's why I'm here.

2085
01:21:34,182 --> 01:21:36,226
I got to admit something.

2086
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:37,602
I, uh...

2087
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:40,897
I fucked Lindsay Lohan.

2088
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:43,858
She was fucked up.
She was high.

2089
01:21:43,942 --> 01:21:45,193
It was at
the Chateau Marmont,

2090
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:46,528
and she kept banging
on my door.

(GRUNTS)

2092
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:49,781
She kept calling
me Jake Gyllenhaal.

2093
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:51,157
That's fucked up.

2094
01:21:51,241 --> 01:21:54,744
Yeah, I said, "Call me
the Prince of Persia."

2095
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:56,037
See, that's what
I'm saying, man.

2096
01:21:56,121 --> 01:21:58,081
We've all done bad shit,
you know?

2097
01:21:58,164 --> 01:22:01,751
We've done more bad shit than
good in our lives, and (SIGHS)

2098
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:06,006
it's time to
pay the piper.
