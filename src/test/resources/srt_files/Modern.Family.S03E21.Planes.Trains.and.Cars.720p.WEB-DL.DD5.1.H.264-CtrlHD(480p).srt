1
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:04,672
How are you doing?
Phil Danoughy.

2
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:06,266
What do I have to get you to ask,

3
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:08,719
"What do I have to do to get you
into this car today?"

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,359
Well, why don't we start with a test drive?

5
00:00:11,652 --> 00:00:12,457
I'll get the keys.

6
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:13,523
Sounds good.

7
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:17,594
Right where I want him.

8
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:19,206
Come here. Come look at this.

9
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:22,088
This thing warns you if you
deviate from your lane.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,279
In my car, that's my wife.

11
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:27,733
"Andre, if you try to kill me,
I swear I will kill you!"

12
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:30,150
Well, I guess this is
what I'll be driving

13
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:31,639
for the next 39 months.

14
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,487
This is my D.N.A. talking,

15
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:36,277
but you do not seem sufficiently excited

16
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:38,282
about the prospect of
driving a new Cadillac.

17
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:40,999
No, it's great.
I've just leased the same thing forever.

18
00:00:41,153 --> 00:00:42,821
Part of me wants to shake things up.

19
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,263
I don't know.

20
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:46,588
Get something like...

21
00:00:47,699 --> 00:00:48,660
Like that.

22
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,796
Oh, wow.

23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,086
Colonel Klink, that is nice.

24
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:56,906
We took Lily on her first train ride.

25
00:00:56,907 --> 00:00:58,589
Just a quick trip to Chinatown.

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:00:59,717
I was worried she would think

27
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:01,154
we were taking her back to Vietnam,

28
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:02,392
but she seemed okay.

29
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:03,516
Yeah, yeah.

30
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:06,160
Possibly because she was an
infant when she left Vietnam.

31
00:01:06,888 --> 00:01:08,461
Also, Vietnam is not China.

32
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:10,729
Well, I had a lollipop
with me just in case.

33
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:13,825
I love that we're doing this.

34
00:01:13,826 --> 00:01:15,985
It's important for her to
explore the city she lives in.

35
00:01:15,986 --> 00:01:17,334
So much diversity.

36
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,108
Keep your wallet in your front pocket.

37
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:20,465
My shoe's untied.

38
00:01:20,466 --> 00:01:22,089
Oh, sweetie, it is. Here, have a seat.

39
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,267
Right here. There you go.
Hey, hold Bunny.

40
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:28,917
No! No, no, no, no, no, no! Bunny!

41
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:31,202
How did you miss that, Mitchell?
Mr. Conductor! I-I...

42
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,021
What?

43
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:33,315
I was purell-ing!

44
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:35,372
And it's me! Why would you toss it?

45
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:36,694
Because my hands were full?

46
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:38,241
I want Bunny!

47
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,130
I know. W--okay, I have an idea.

48
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,234
Let's catch the next train and
ride it till it catches up.

49
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:44,600
They don't catch up.
That's called a collision.

50
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:45,724
Okay, well, do you have a better idea?

51
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:48,344
You're the one that lost it.
No, you tossed it.

52
00:01:48,345 --> 00:01:49,781
He who tossed it lost it.

53
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:51,093
Don't try to clever your way out of this.

54
00:01:51,094 --> 00:01:52,309
Daddy lost Bunny.

55
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,586
She means you.

56
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,155
Oh, I wanted a car like
this since I was a kid.

57
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:58,236
Me, too.

58
00:01:58,505 --> 00:02:00,778
I used to imagine the wind
blowing through my perm,

59
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:02,004
blasting some Hall & Oates,

60
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:05,575
maybe horsing around with
my Mr. Microphone...

61
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:07,795
Yeah, we wouldn't have
been friends back then.

62
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:09,595
You should buy it.

63
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,583
No, it's not practical.

64
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:14,239
Practical? You never see a
person on their deathbed

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,296
saying, "I wish I'd have
been more practical."

66
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,526
I see a lot of people on
their deathbed, Phil.

67
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:19,432
A lot.

68
00:02:19,541 --> 00:02:21,511
I thought you operated on knees and elbows.

69
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:23,293
Phil, this is a nice car.

70
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,327
And it's half the price of a new car.

71
00:02:25,594 --> 00:02:26,982
If you don't buy it, I will.

72
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:29,225
What would Claire say?

73
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:32,321
You know what? Maybe we should find you

74
00:02:32,322 --> 00:02:34,003
something with a little
more lumbar support.

75
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:36,071
Yeah. You know, with you not
having a spine and all.

76
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,377
I have a spine. Do you have a spine?

77
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:40,566
I have a spine.
So wanna take it for a spin?

78
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,498
You know what?
I'd rather take her for a spin.

79
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,653
Let's get her top down
and see what she can do.

80
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,817
I'm--no, I meant the convertible.

81
00:02:47,846 --> 00:03:00,841

82
00:03:02,903 --> 00:03:04,490
Well, I just talked to the concierge,

83
00:03:04,491 --> 00:03:06,337
and room service will
save me a bread pudding.

84
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:07,544
Load off my mind.

85
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:09,410
You mock me, but "Travel and Leisure"

86
00:03:09,411 --> 00:03:10,754
says it's not to be missed.

87
00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:13,610
This weekend, we're going
up to Pebble Beach.

88
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,150
I'm gonna meet a bunch of guys

89
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:16,895
I played high school football with.

90
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:18,760
Man, those were the good old days.

91
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,666
Yeah, unless you were a woman,
black, Hispanic, or gay.

92
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:24,537
True, but if you were a straight white guy

93
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:25,634
who played football,

94
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,998
you really couldn't have a bad day.

95
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,070
Gloria? Hmm?

96
00:03:30,288 --> 00:03:31,698
Which watch should I pack?

97
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:34,343
This one's showier.
This one's more expensive.

98
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,295
Why do you care so much about a watch?

99
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:38,238
How do I say this without
sounding like an ass?

100
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,675
I'm kind of a legend to these guys.

101
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:42,147
Not like that.

102
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:53,118
Who's your daddy?

103
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:55,135
Whoa! Whose car is this?

104
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:57,119
Mine! I talked him into it.

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,184
Seriously? Mom's gonna let you have this?

106
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:00,979
Luke, Luke, Luke...

107
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,690
Where is she?

108
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:04,174
Dad, I don't like this.

109
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:05,037
Why not?

110
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,859
My friend Molly's dad bought a sports car,

111
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,340
and now he lives in a studio apartment

112
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:10,304
and dates a girl who works at forever 21,

113
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,247
which she won't be for two years.

114
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:13,664
Hear that?

115
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,632
Honey, I'm not leaving your mom.

116
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,027
Might not be your call.

117
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,641
Oh, my God, it's so pretty!

118
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:20,757
I love it! And I love you,

119
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,836
and I promise I'll take
super good care of it!

120
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:23,873
Can I tell her?

121
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:25,376
Please. I ask for so little.

122
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,821
Alex, be nice to your sister.
It's dad's car, not yours.

123
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:30,845
What? But you're too old for this!

124
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:32,429
It's just like last year

125
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,625
when you wouldn't take
off those skinny jeans.

126
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:35,656
Wouldn't or couldn't?

127
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:37,038
Hey. I looked hot.

128
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,854
And you look hot in this car.

129
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:40,564
Let me tell you something about your dad.

130
00:04:40,565 --> 00:04:42,239
Your dad is a man who knows what he wants,

131
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,794
and he gets it.
Oh.

132
00:04:44,398 --> 00:04:46,153
At least that's what I heard.
You know, I was there

133
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:48,787
more as a friend and an
observer than anything.

134
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:51,433
Andre. Hey, Claire.

135
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:54,198
Honey. Is this the new car?

136
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,367
I know it looks impractical,

137
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:58,059
but Andre's seen a lot of people die.

138
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,938
I'm not upset.

139
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:01,345
I'm not upset. It's a beautiful car.

140
00:05:01,346 --> 00:05:03,638
Just surprised you didn't
get the sedan, that's all.

141
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,866
Beautiful. Good seeing, you, Cl--

142
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,428
Mm. Beautiful.

143
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:13,494
What just happened?

144
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:15,221
She did not blink once.

145
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:17,416
Do you wanna come in for a minute?

146
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,119
No, I gotta...
you know, I gotta get to the wife.

147
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,855
Well, do you...

148
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:21,432
Uh, do you need a ride or anything?
No. No, no,

149
00:05:21,433 --> 00:05:22,587
I'm gonna, uh, I'm-a jog.

150
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,323
Why--why are you running?
I'm just gonna jog!

151
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,438
Lily was up all night because
she didn't have Bnny,

152
00:05:31,012 --> 00:05:32,730
which means that we were up all night

153
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:35,147
because she didn't have Bunny.

154
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:37,125
God, she must have cried for...

155
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,632
How long was it, Cam?

156
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,354
Cam. Cam. Hmm?

157
00:05:41,126 --> 00:05:42,143
Oh, sorry.

158
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:44,046
Uh, last night was rough because Lily...

159
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:45,582
Covered it. Didn't have Bunny.

160
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:50,782
Jay, tell me, why are we on the runway?

161
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:53,520
Surprise! We're taking a private plane.

162
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:55,893
Wow! I've never been on a private plane!

163
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:57,331
And you never will.

164
00:05:57,332 --> 00:05:59,674
I am not getting on that little thing!

165
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:02,702
What if the rubber band snaps
and we fall out of the sky?

166
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:05,121
It's perfectly safe.
It's a legitimate airline!

167
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,406
Hey, folks.

168
00:06:06,547 --> 00:06:08,322
Whoa. Nobody said three.

169
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,905
All right. Before we take off,

170
00:06:09,906 --> 00:06:11,254
I'm gonna need to get
everyone's weight here.

171
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:13,569
No problem. I'm about 190.
Okay.

172
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,816
Oh, yeah. In that case, I'm 275.

173
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:18,733
Gloria, I would never put
you and Manny in danger.

174
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:20,795
Now come on! Trust me on this!

175
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,197
Beautiful.

176
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:29,524
It's American music the whole way,

177
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:31,212
and I don't wanna hear a word.

178
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:47,107
How you doing there, sport?
Great. Yeah.

179
00:06:47,108 --> 00:06:48,569
Awesome. You know what's awesome?

180
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,851
Is this car has the engine in the trunk,

181
00:06:50,852 --> 00:06:52,877
so that means I get to...

182
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:56,211
put these signs in the seat, which is cool.

183
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:57,915
Very cool.

184
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,896
Huh.
What?

185
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,790
Oh, nothing. My, uh, client just wants me

186
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,251
to pick her up on the
way to the open house,

187
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:11,678
which is great. I'll, uh, drop the sign off

188
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,430
and just swing across town to...

189
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,310
Oh. She's bringing her mom and a designer.

190
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,730
Well, maybe they'll fit in the trunk.

191
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:19,867
Here it comes!

192
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:22,202
What? I was making a joke.

193
00:07:22,535 --> 00:07:23,449
What's your game, woman?

194
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,663
I have no game. You're an adult.
You can make your own choices.

195
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:27,780
Since when?

196
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,487
Do you wanna borrow the minivan?

197
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,243
Yes, please.

198
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,443
Okay, fine. Then you're gonna have
to pick up the kids from school.

199
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:35,972
Okay, I can't take it.

200
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:37,419
If you got something to say, just say it.

201
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:38,739
I have nothing to say.

202
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,211
That just says it all. Well...

203
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:47,583
All--all right. Thank you, Serena.

204
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:48,579
See you tonight.

205
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:51,765
Good news--they rescheduled
my massage for the morning.

206
00:07:52,117 --> 00:07:53,429
Bad news--it's a dude.

207
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,288
Don't blame me. It's your mom's fault.

208
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:57,549
Do you know how many people
have died in these planes?

209
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,504
John Denver, Patsy Cline, Ritchie Valens.

210
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:02,219
I've heard you sing. I think you're safe.

211
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,517
All right, look,

212
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:04,962
the welcome dinner starts in four hours.

213
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:07,435
It's a 5-hour drive. No bathroom breaks.

214
00:08:09,626 --> 00:08:11,641
Yeah, I think you're gonna
want to hold on to that cup.

215
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,442
Damn it!

216
00:08:13,443 --> 00:08:15,242
What was that?
Giant pothole.

217
00:08:15,243 --> 00:08:16,825
The dash is lighting up
like a Christmas tree.

218
00:08:16,826 --> 00:08:18,029
Tire's blown!

219
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:19,931
This never would have happened
if we were in the air!

220
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:21,954
If this had happened in the air,
we wouldn't be in the air.

221
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:23,609
We would be in rock 'n' roll heaven!

222
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,124
Okay, what do you think?

223
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:28,932
I'm gonna put these in the subway.

224
00:08:29,632 --> 00:08:31,404
Okay, it looks like, uh, Lily's missing

225
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,222
and we're offering $25 to get her back.

226
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,328
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
No one in their right mind--

227
00:08:35,329 --> 00:08:37,011
Okay. That's all I see now.

228
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,473
How about this one? Okay. Um...

229
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:42,044
"Missing--stuffed bunny.
Brown and white fur.

230
00:08:42,045 --> 00:08:44,561
Sympathetic eyes."
What are sympathetic eyes?

231
00:08:44,562 --> 00:08:45,706
Not those.

232
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:48,225
I just--I don't really love the idea

233
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:50,142
of our phone number being up in the subway.

234
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,340
Okay, let's play a different game.

235
00:08:51,341 --> 00:08:53,740
How about I be the problem,
and you be the solution?

236
00:08:54,162 --> 00:08:56,071
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be so critical.

237
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:57,990
I know you're just trying to--
Got it!

238
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,215
Just came up with a better idea.

239
00:08:59,216 --> 00:09:00,826
Took me less than five seconds.

240
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:10,448
Okay...

241
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,081
I can't hear you. What?

242
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:17,409
Window.

243
00:09:17,544 --> 00:09:18,563
I don't know...

244
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,374
Gah! What did I do?

245
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:22,744
Oh. Oh, my.

246
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:25,043
Yes. Hi. Hey, nice car.

247
00:09:25,044 --> 00:09:26,121
Thank you.

248
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:28,485
You gonna drive up the coast, or...

249
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:31,080
Oh, no. I'm gonna do
some errands, actually.

250
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:33,591
Yeah, 'cause other people
might go and buy a crazy car

251
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:36,015
with an engine in the--
in the trunk, but not me.

252
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:38,401
No. I'm responsible.
Mm-hmm.

253
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:41,322
We have three kids.
You can't pick up three kids in this car.

254
00:09:41,323 --> 00:09:42,222
You can't.

255
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:43,811
You--it... it...

256
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,829
I'll get you... catch ya.

257
00:09:47,805 --> 00:09:48,887
I'm going!

258
00:09:48,917 --> 00:09:51,098
Maybe I was a teeny bit mad.

259
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:55,461
So I blew off my errands
and headed up the coast.

260
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,661
It was my turn to be irresponsible.

261
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:01,296
And luckily, I had sunscreen in my purse.

262
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:05,749
Well, your strut's shot,

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,388
and we can't get parts for at least a day.

264
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:09,752
Fantastic.

265
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:11,866
I don't suppose there's any place

266
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,702
you can rent cars anywhere around here?

267
00:10:13,703 --> 00:10:16,036
Know what, sir?
We're not some one-horse town.

268
00:10:16,057 --> 00:10:17,322
Of course you can rent a car.

269
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,044
It just happens to be out for the day.

270
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,097
Unbelievable.

271
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:24,893
We're gonna miss the whole weekend.
I am sorry, Jay.

272
00:10:24,894 --> 00:10:26,395
I know how much you mean to those guys,

273
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,692
and I know how much they want to see you.

274
00:10:28,693 --> 00:10:31,161
I'm so sorry. Uh, excuse me.

275
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:33,764
You are... so pretty.

276
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,173
And if you really need to get somewhere,

277
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:39,426
maybe I can help you out.

278
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:41,924
Ay, yes, please! Thank you! Anything!

279
00:10:44,232 --> 00:10:47,100
Check it out. Restored it myself.

280
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:49,831
No.

281
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:52,996
I did not get in the little
plane at the little airport!

282
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:55,453
I'm not gonna get in this...
takka-takka-takka-takka

283
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,724
flown by that guy that
couldn't fix our car!

284
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,637
Gloria, it's either this,
or we're in the motel.

285
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,293
I don't like the sound of that.

286
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,301
A lot of amenities disappear
when an "H" becomes an "M."

287
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:06,707
You know, when I met you,

288
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,715
you were eating cereal out of a bucket.

289
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:12,753
Hey, Lily, guess what?

290
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:13,582
What?

291
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:15,916
Uh, we just heard from Bunny.

292
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,021
This is a terrible idea.

293
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:18,317
No, it's fantastic.

294
00:11:18,465 --> 00:11:20,828
Bunny said he's on an amazing adventure

295
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:22,506
having the time of his life,

296
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:25,550
and that you should pick
one of his best friends

297
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:27,426
to sleep with while he's gone.

298
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:28,916
Bunny doesn't talk.

299
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,222
This is going great.

300
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:33,575
He does now, because-- because
he took talking lessons.

301
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:34,807
So what do you think, huh?

302
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:37,223
Turtle or giraffe

303
00:11:37,224 --> 00:11:39,489
or, uh, little reindeer?

304
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,705
Where's Bunny now?

305
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:42,143
Uh, St. Louis.

306
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:43,094
Why?

307
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:45,160
He's visiting his girlfriend.

308
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:46,999
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

309
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,406
He has a boyfriend!

310
00:11:50,313 --> 00:11:51,508
I want Bunny!

311
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:52,542
Okay. No, no, Lily.

312
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,608
Lily, uh, what about Miss, uh, Teddy Bear?

313
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:58,491
Huh? No? Uh, Dr. Tiger? No?

314
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:02,626
Mr. Fish? I want Bunny.
I'm going to St. Louis.

315
00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:05,403
Really? You don't know Nemo?

316
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:06,912
It's on an endless loop in the den.

317
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,362
I have a job.

318
00:12:08,482 --> 00:12:10,038
And then Bodie kicked it to me,

319
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:12,476
and I dribbled it past Michael
and got it to Tyler...

320
00:12:12,477 --> 00:12:14,577
I was bummed not to be in my new cool car,

321
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:17,842
so I wasn't joking around with
the kids like I usually do.

322
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:20,238
And I would've scored if
that kid didn't trip me.

323
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:22,131
I can't believe the ref didn't see it.

324
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,881
I bet Olivia saw it.

325
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:25,752
She's always watching you when you play.

326
00:12:25,753 --> 00:12:28,605
Yeah, I know.
It's like she's in love with soccer.

327
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,850
Ugh. Stop texting me!

328
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,372
What?

329
00:12:34,373 --> 00:12:36,088
Corey. He is so clingy.

330
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:42,356
But, you know, there's something
about driving your kids around.

331
00:12:42,508 --> 00:12:44,234
You're in the front, they're in the back.

332
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:46,453
They forget you're there,
and you learn so much.

333
00:12:46,912 --> 00:12:49,379
You're like Sigourney Weaver
in "Gorillas in the Mist."

334
00:12:49,807 --> 00:12:52,027
Except gorillas make less noise chewing.

335
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:59,254
Once I hit the coast
highway, I didn't stop.

336
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,534
I turned off my cell phone.

337
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:05,257
I ate fish tacos for lunch. It was insane!

338
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,369
I haven't felt that free in years.

339
00:13:08,337 --> 00:13:11,363
All my stress completely disappeared...

340
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,337
And so did my keys.

341
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,689
I'm sorry, but...
these signs are ridiculous.

342
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,568
Oh, you're right.
I should have used Helvetica.

343
00:13:28,569 --> 00:13:31,055
It much better represents the
urgency of our situation.

344
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:33,350
No, the lengths that we're
going to for a stuffed animal.

345
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:36,094
You know, Cam, maybe it's
time Lily learned about loss.

346
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:39,148
No, she's 3, and I know.
Do you know how many times

347
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,116
I had to say good-bye to a
furry friend on the farm?

348
00:13:41,117 --> 00:13:42,395
And didn't it make you stronger?

349
00:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,617
Yeah, because I was a growing boy

350
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:44,911
and they were chock-full of protein.

351
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:46,640
But it was still heartbreaking.

352
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:47,774
It builds character.

353
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:49,400
You know, once, when I was a kid,

354
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:51,883
my dad left my Luke Skywalker
doll on an airplane,

355
00:13:51,884 --> 00:13:54,445
and I was so angry--
Wait, which--which Luke?

356
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:55,741
Shorty robe or dress blacks?

357
00:13:55,742 --> 00:13:57,347
Shorty robe. Oh, my.

358
00:13:57,348 --> 00:13:58,787
And you know what he did to get it back?

359
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:00,755
Not a damn thing. Nope.

360
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,124
He didn't lift one pudgy finger

361
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,902
to make a single phone
call, and I got over it.

362
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:06,102
Yeah, well, I want you and Lily

363
00:14:06,103 --> 00:14:07,673
to have the same healthy relationship

364
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,635
you and your father have. For sure.

365
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,304
All right, give me these flyers.

366
00:14:12,864 --> 00:14:14,941
I'm gonna take everything to
this side of the homeless guy.

367
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:16,746
Mitchell! Sorry, what are
we supposed to say now?

368
00:14:16,747 --> 00:14:18,244
Home-challenged? Or...

369
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,567
No, look!

370
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,801
Oh, my God! It's Bunny!

371
00:14:22,802 --> 00:14:23,913
Oh, Lily's gonna be so happy.

372
00:14:23,914 --> 00:14:25,645
Oh, that's so great. Go ahead and get it.

373
00:14:25,784 --> 00:14:27,032
What, me?
Yeah.

374
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,261
Why should I go and get it?

375
00:14:28,262 --> 00:14:29,516
Well, I-I'm not gonna do it.

376
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:30,523
Why? I spotted it.

377
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:31,423
You're closer.

378
00:14:31,424 --> 00:14:32,920
It's your journey. Luke Skywalker?

379
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:34,566
Pattern-breaking?
Your father? Get in there.

380
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:35,569
Fine.

381
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,028
Sir--hi, sir.

382
00:14:40,282 --> 00:14:41,518
Hello, you--you...

383
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,520
Hello.

384
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,786
Yeah. Hello.

385
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,776
He-hello? Sir...

386
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:53,564
I-I can't... oh, for God sakes!

387
00:15:00,661 --> 00:15:02,010
Let her hate us. You turned out great.

388
00:15:02,011 --> 00:15:03,867
I did, didn't I? You're a big lawyer.

389
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,008
This is not the massage I had in mind.

390
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:13,179
All right.

391
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,287
Okay.

392
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:18,612
In about an hour, a train goes through town

393
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,368
that will get us close to pebble beach.

394
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:23,273
Now it's not technically
a-a passenger train,

395
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,193
so it won't be stopping.
What?

396
00:15:25,194 --> 00:15:26,771
So we gotta get running real good.

397
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,861
No high-heeled shoes.
And it wouldn't be wrong

398
00:15:28,862 --> 00:15:30,801
if we took that blanket
with us, either, huh?

399
00:15:30,925 --> 00:15:33,680
So what do you say?
Anybody up for a hobo adventure?

400
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,447
If we're voting, I'm a "no."

401
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,018
Manny, we're gonna be right back.

402
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:40,984
We're gonna get some ice from
the machine in the parking lot.

403
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,744
Classy.

404
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:50,372
Jay, this is getting crazy. Is it worth it?

405
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:51,492
I wanna see the old gang.

406
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,213
Do you wanna see them or you
want to show off to them?

407
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,889
The private plane, the fancy watch.

408
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,118
You still want to feel

409
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,196
that you're the big kahuna on the campus.

410
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:02,213
That's not it. That's not even a thing.

411
00:16:02,214 --> 00:16:04,040
You know what? I'm taking Manny home.

412
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,727
If you want to go in the
takka-takka-takka-takka,

413
00:16:06,728 --> 00:16:08,712
okay. Go to Pebble Beach by yourself.

414
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:10,328
No, what? That's not the plan.

415
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:12,098
If you wanna go there so bad,

416
00:16:12,099 --> 00:16:13,638
that's the only way you're gonna get there.

417
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,319
I'm not trying to get me there.

418
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:16,726
I'm trying to get you there!

419
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,545
What? Look...

420
00:16:20,869 --> 00:16:24,885
I may have exaggerated the size...
kahuna I was.

421
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,498
I may not...

422
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:30,479
technically have been a kahuna.

423
00:16:31,817 --> 00:16:35,310
I was shy, and I spent most of my time...

424
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,337
on the bench.

425
00:16:38,616 --> 00:16:40,049
But you always made it sound like you--

426
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,954
Oh, I know what I made it sound like.

427
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:47,548
People didn't expect much from me,

428
00:16:49,068 --> 00:16:50,112
and, um...

429
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,058
They certainly didn't expect me

430
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,296
to end up with... somebody like you.

431
00:16:57,368 --> 00:16:59,298
So this is all about you

432
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:02,476
parading me around like a trophy?

433
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:04,768
Yes.

434
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,380
Why didn't you say so?

435
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:07,933
I can be a trophy!

436
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:13,050
Come on. We need to get
this up to Pebble Beach.

437
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,923
Manny! We're leaving! Get ready!

438
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,660
Oh, good. If we get out of
here in the next ten minutes,

439
00:17:18,661 --> 00:17:20,332
we don't have to pay for the second hour.

440
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,881
How you doing there, sport?

441
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,429
I'm sorry. That's okay.

442
00:17:30,098 --> 00:17:31,199
Thanks.

443
00:17:31,434 --> 00:17:32,532
So...

444
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:34,267
Whatcha doing all the way up here?

445
00:17:37,102 --> 00:17:38,468
Did someone snap?

446
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:39,962
A little. Yeah.

447
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:42,557
I was mad at you for buying
that stupid sports car.

448
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:43,709
I knew it!

449
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,881
And I was wrong.

450
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:48,867
It's a great car. God, I had the best day.

451
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:50,899
Phil, I did cartwheels.

452
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,325
Without me?
Mm-hmm.

453
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:53,805
Yeah.

454
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:01,546
Hey, did you know there's a
girl with a crush on Luke?

455
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,141
Olivia. Yeah.

456
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:07,775
Oh, and Haley's totally done with Corey.

457
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,016
That's new.

458
00:18:09,569 --> 00:18:11,308
Alex is teaching herself Chinese

459
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:13,582
so she'll be useful when
they finish buying us.

460
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:15,694
She's so weird.

461
00:18:18,942 --> 00:18:20,956
I really want to be able
to drive the kids around.

462
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:24,821
I need a bigger car for work.
I made a mistake.

463
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:28,075
No, you didn't. You bought it for a reason.

464
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,968
When did we stop coming to the beach?

465
00:18:36,521 --> 00:18:37,591
I think it was when Alex

466
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:39,927
started printing out water quality reports.

467
00:18:40,456 --> 00:18:42,179
She'll be China's problem soon.

468
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:44,447
You know...

469
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,579
We don't need a sports car to get out here.

470
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:50,366
Mm. We should just make a pact.

471
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,443
Once a month, we get out to the beach.

472
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,689
And we tell everyone we're running errands.

473
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,894
Yeah. Yeah.

474
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:06,198
So you didn't get to the dry cleaner?

475
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:10,161
They say the important thing in life

476
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:11,663
isn't the destination.

477
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,919
It's the journey,

478
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:18,564
the challenges you face along the way...

479
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,099
The unexpected twists and turns...

480
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:26,275
The disappointments you overcome.

481
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:28,403
Look what I found on the Internet.

482
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:31,707
Oh, my God! It's Luke
Skywalker in his shorty robe!

483
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,450
I love it, Cam--
No. Mine!

484
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:34,753
But they're wrong.

485
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,372
It's all about the destination,

486
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,250
especially when the destination

487
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:40,343
is your amazing oceanfront hotel.

488
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,298
Thank you again, Serena.

489
00:19:42,322 --> 00:19:44,716
Warmest regards, Manny Delgado.

490
00:19:44,921 --> 00:19:45,666
What's he doing?

491
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,658
He's sending flowers to the concierge.

492
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:49,331
Oh, jeez. Hey...

493
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:50,962
Credit card.

494
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:57,743
She wore you down, didn't she?

495
00:19:57,744 --> 00:19:59,146
This is not about Claire.

496
00:19:59,147 --> 00:20:00,863
I really want to sell you the car.

497
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:04,188
It's sad. She got you to believe that.

498
00:20:04,189 --> 00:20:05,450
No, I...

499
00:20:05,451 --> 00:20:07,296
Turns out I'm just not a convertible guy.

500
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:09,682
Well, your loss is my gain.

501
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:12,094
It's a sweet ride, Phil. Right?

502
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:13,236
It really is.

503
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,520
Uh-oh. What?

504
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:21,758
I'm getting, like, a whiff of mildew.

505
00:20:22,812 --> 00:20:23,940
I don't smell anything.

506
00:20:26,452 --> 00:20:27,845
Yep. That's mildew.

507
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,766
Huh?
This car's been in the flood.

508
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,151
It's a Katrina car!

509
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:34,271
I'm offended that you tried to
sell me a Katrina car, Phil!

510
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:36,062
Your wife won't let you have
a convertible, will she?

511
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:38,210
We will never know,
'cause I'm afraid to ask.

512
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:39,970
See you later, Phil.

513
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:44,290
Why are you running again?

514
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:50,560
