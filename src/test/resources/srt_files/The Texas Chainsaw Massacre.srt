1
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:19,972
(radio announcer) It is believed that
the indictment is only one of a series

2
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:24,893
to be handed down as the result of
a special grand jury investigation.

3
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,105
Graverobbing in Texas
is this hour's top news story.

4
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:32,401
An informant led officers of the Muerto
County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery

5
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,655
just outside the small rural Texas
community of Newt early this morning.

6
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,325
Officers there discovered
what appeared to be a grisly work of art,

7
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,997
the remains of a badly decomposed body
wired to a large monument.

8
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:49,084
A second body was found in a ditch
near the perimeter of the cemetery.

9
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,213
Subsequent investigation has revealed
at least a dozen empty crypts,

10
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,508
and it's feared more will turn up
as the probe continues.

11
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:01,305
Deputies report that in some instances,
only parts of a corpse had been removed,

12
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,141
the head or in some cases
the extremities removed,

13
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,685
the remainder of the corpse left intact.

14
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,564
Evidence indicates the robberies
have occurred over a period of time.

15
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:14,818
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado refused
to give details of the ghoulish case

16
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,279
and said only that
he did have strong evidence

17
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,407
linking the crime to elements
outside the state.

18
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,785
Area residents have reportedly converged
on the cemetery,

19
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,788
fearing the remains of relatives
have been removed.

20
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,959
No suspects are in custody, as
the investigation at the scene continues.

21
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,880
Oil storage units
continue to burn out of control

22
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,967
at the huge Texaco refinery
near the Texas-Louisiana border.

23
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,720
Three storage units exploded
into flames during the night,

24
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:45,265
killing at least three workers
and injuring a dozen more.

25
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,478
Fire-fighting units in three Texas cities
continue to battle the holocaust,

26
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,147
in an effort to confine 40-foot flames.

27
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:57,027
Smoke from the fire is visible to Houston
residents some 60 miles to the south.

28
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,780
Health officials in San Francisco
reluctantly admit

29
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,449
they may have a cholera epidemic
on their hands.

30
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:07,037
Some 40 cases of the highly infectious
disease have been confirmed.

31
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,582
(news report continues indistinct)

32
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,086
...is responsible for spread of the disease.

33
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,922
Houston police are puzzled over
an outbreak of violence

34
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,466
apparently touched off by a suicide.

35
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,096
A young man, reportedly angered by a
local television blackout of a sports event,

36
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,932
jumped from the tenth-story window
of his apartment.

37
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:31,103
A second man allegedly threatened to
leap to his death from the same window,

38
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,272
but was restrained by police.

39
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,608
Witnesses to the incident
reportedly heard the man jump...

40
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,736
(news report continues indistinct)

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,621
She offered no explanation for the attack.

42
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:54,751
The lieutenant was treated for minor
wounds at the hospital and released.

43
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:59,589
A 16-story building under construction
in downtown Atlanta collapsed today,

44
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,050
killing at least 29 persons.

45
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,138
The engineering firm responsible for
the structural design of the building

46
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,016
could offer no explanation for the collapse.

47
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,312
The construction firm says
there's no logical reason for the collapse

48
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,981
and suspects sabotage.

49
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:19,026
Police in Gary, Indiana,
have been unable to identify

50
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,236
the bodies of a young man and woman...

51
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,447
(continues indistinct)

52
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,244
...stab wounds
and their features carved away.

53
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,455
The man's genitals had been removed,

54
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,000
and police first identified the victims
as two women.

55
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,794
(news report continues low)

56
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,269
OK?

57
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,211
(screams)

58
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,255
Franklin!

59
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,678
Ah!

60
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,311
- Are you OK?
- I was... Shit.

61
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,232
OK.

62
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,069
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take much more.

63
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,864
Listen, the condition of retrogradation
is contrary or inharmonious to

64
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,326
the regular direction
of actual movement in the zodiac

65
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,162
and is, in that respect, evil.

66
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,040
Hence, when malefic planets
are in retrograde -

67
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,336
and Saturn's malefic, OK? -
their maleficence is increased.

68
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,089
Have you been doing
those word power columns?

69
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,550
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.

70
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:11,012
It's just particularly a bad influence now
because it's in retrograde.

71
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:14,182
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me?
- I don't know.

72
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,496
My granddaddy's buried here.
Did anything happen to him?

73
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,249
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- That big feller

74
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,919
at the stand with that flashlight in his hand,
that's the sheriff.

75
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,131
You tell him your granddaddy's
buried in there.

76
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,841
- He'll let you in.
- Thank you.

77
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:52,095
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute.
Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.

78
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,265
Let us through.
This girl's granddaddy's buried here.

79
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:58,101
Been in there the whole time,
unbeknownst to Clyde.

80
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,104
Clyde didn't know, either.
They didn't know why...

81
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,025
Things happen hereabout
they don't tell about.

82
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,030
I see things.

83
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:18,246
You see, they say
it's just an old man talking.

84
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,583
You laugh at an old man.

85
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,588
There's them that laughs and knows better.

86
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:38,058
(Sally) They're sure. The man said they
could tell if the grave had been dug up.

87
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:42,729
Franklin, don't worry. I saw it myself.
It didn't look dug up to me.

88
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,070
- (Sally) Oh, what's that?
- What smells?

89
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,282
What is that stench?

90
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,743
Roll up the window.

91
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,541
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.

92
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,419
That's where Grandpa used to
sell his cattle.

93
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,340
We got an uncle that works at one of
those places outside of Ft. Worth.

94
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:15,887
That's where they kill them. They bash
them in the head with a sledgehammer.

95
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,975
- (Pam) That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.

96
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,453
They'd start squealing and freaking out,
and they'd have to bash 'em three times.

97
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,165
They'd skin them sometimes
before they were even dead.

98
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,211
(Pam) That's horrible.
People shouldn't kill animals for food.

99
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,255
They don't do it like that anymore.

100
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,593
Now they got this big gun that shoots
a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.

101
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,178
It's just boom! It goes boom!
And boom!

102
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,223
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.

103
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,935
- Boom!
- That's terrible. It's still going on.

104
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,356
Oh, man, it's hot in here.

105
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,115
- Hitchhiker.
- Should we pick him up?

106
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,535
- Yeah. He'll asphyxiate out there.
- What does he look like?

107
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,288
Son of a bitch is gonna
smell like a slaughterhouse.

108
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,249
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.

109
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,293
- What do you want to do?
- He's weird-looking.

110
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,003
- Pick him up, man.
- No!

111
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,775
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.

112
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,653
- Where you headed, man?
- South.

113
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,780
You work at that place?

114
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,657
Oh, no.

115
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:02,911
- How did you get stuck way out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.

116
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,831
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.

117
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,125
My-my grandfather too.

118
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,004
My family's always been in meat.

119
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,674
A whole family of Draculas.

120
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,219
Hey, man, did you go
in that slaughter room?

121
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,971
Where they shoot the cattle
with that big air gun?

122
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:26,559
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.

123
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,354
The old way with a sledge.

124
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,108
See, that was better.
They died better that way.

125
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,235
How come? I thought the gun was better.

126
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,529
Oh, no, no.

127
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,116
With the new way,
the people are put out of jobs.

128
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,201
You do that?

129
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,619
Look.

130
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,544
- I was the killer. (laughs)
- Damn.

131
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,880
- (Sally) Let me see them.
- They don't send the heads away.

132
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,049
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,801
Franklin.

134
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,848
See, they make head cheese.

135
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,808
They...

136
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,228
they take the head,

137
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,064
and they boil it,
except for the tongue,

138
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,818
and they scrape all the flesh
away from the bone.

139
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,821
They use everything.
They don't throw nothing way.

140
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,906
They use the jowls

141
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,869
and the muscles and the eyes
and ligaments and everything.

142
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,746
- Oh.
- Look at this.

143
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,917
The nose and the gums and all the flesh,
and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.

144
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,628
Wow. I didn't know
that's what was in that stuff.

145
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,047
It's really good. You like it?

146
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,426
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it.
It's good.

147
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,971
It sounds horrible.
Could we talk about something else?

148
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,599
You'd like it
if you didn't know what was in it.

149
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,435
I wouldn't,
and I wish you'd stop talking about it.

150
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,770
Oh.

151
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:54,189
Come on, you're making everybody sick.

152
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,274
Oh, all right.

153
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,240
(chuckles)

154
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,000
(Sally) What are you doing?

155
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,463
Hey, man, put that knife up.

156
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,384
(laughs)

157
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,221
(Sally gasps) Oh!

158
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,348
(Kirk) Oh, come on.

159
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,351
(Sally) Oh! What are you doing to yourself?

160
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,438
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?

161
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,446
(laughing)

162
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,574
Put that away.

163
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,661
(♪ "Fool for a Blonde" plays on radio)

164
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,265
I have this knife.

165
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,101
Put that away, too.

166
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,856
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.

167
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,941
Fold it up.

168
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,279
(chuckles)

169
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,735
Hey, you took my picture.

170
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:06,654
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.

171
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,240
I live right off this road.

172
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:13,411
Well, I don't know, man.
We're in pretty much of a hurry.

173
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,581
- How close is it?
- It's real close.

174
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:21,336
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close.

175
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,422
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.

176
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,426
You like head cheese?
My brother makes it real good. You'll like it.

177
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,388
I think you better push on now.
Don't you, Jerry?

178
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,682
Yeah, I'm sorry.

179
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,445
(laughs)

180
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,165
It didn't turn out so good.

181
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,628
- It's a nice picture. You can pay me now.
- Huh?

182
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,631
Two dollars. It's a good picture.

183
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,259
No, man.
Franklin, give him back the damn picture.

184
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,804
- He tried to sell him that picture.
- You're kidding?

185
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,931
No, I'm serious.

186
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,968
(screaming)

187
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,429
What are you doing?

188
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,098
(all yelling)

189
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,394
(Kirk) Hey, Jerry, pull us over!

190
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:05,148
(Franklin) Hey, man, what's up?
What are you doing?

191
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,066
(screaming)

192
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,323
Get out.

193
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,516
(cries)

194
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,560
Oh, my God.

195
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:45,605
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.

196
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:49,525
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker
I ever pick up.

197
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:59,660
(Pam) Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.

198
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,995
Oh, Sally.

199
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,499
"Travel in the country,
long-range plans

200
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,876
"and upsetting persons around you

201
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,339
"could make this a disturbing
and unpredictable day.

202
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:15,635
The events in the world are not
doing much either to cheer one up."

203
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:19,347
- That's just perfect.
- Franklin, I think that will be all right.

204
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,850
And now read Sally's.
She's a Capricorn.

205
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,401
Oh, no.

206
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,862
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.

207
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,409
"There are moments when we cannot
believe that what is happening is true.

208
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,621
Pinch yourself
and you may find out that it is."

209
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,415
(♪ country music playing on radio)

210
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,191
Everybody out.

211
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,697
Hurry up, so we can get home.

212
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,999
Here comes somebody.

213
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,590
How are you?

214
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,094
Would you fill her up, please?

215
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,014
I got no gas.

216
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:46,267
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.

217
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,520
The transport won't be here
until late this afternoon,

218
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,441
maybe not even until tomorrow morning.

219
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:57,195
(Franklin) Hey, do you know where
the old Franklin place is?

220
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,659
- The old Franklin place?
- Yeah.

221
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,412
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.

222
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,958
I think you have to turn on that road
back there, but I'm not real sure.

223
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,296
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that
up that way.

224
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:21,385
Well, now look, you boys don't want
to go messing around no old house.

225
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,430
Those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.

226
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,098
We'll be careful.

227
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,852
You don't want to go fooling around
with other folks' property.

228
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,980
Some folks don't like it,
and they don't mind showing you.

229
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,567
- Oh, my father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?

230
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,610
Yeah.

231
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,905
Look, I got some good barbeque here.

232
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,699
Why don't you fellas
stick around here a while?

233
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,119
That transport will be by in a little while.

234
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,916
(Jerry) Well, you want to get
some barbeque?

235
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,088
Them girls, now, they don't want to
go messing around an old house.

236
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,715
It's best you stick around here.

237
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,896
We should've asked
if there's another gas station around.

238
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,941
Don't you think he would've told us
if there was?

239
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,236
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?

240
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,363
OK, I'll go ask.

241
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,245
I knew the hell we should've
stopped back there for gas.

242
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,831
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.

243
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,917
- There.
- You think this place has room service?

244
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,631
Franklin, you maniac,
you're tearing up the van.

245
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,635
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.

246
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,892
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.

247
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,979
Look at that. Look at that.

248
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:58,399
- You think that's blood?
- Yeah, I guess so.

249
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:05,948
Oh, that's blood, all right.
And that guy cut the hell out of himself.

250
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,160
You think you could do that to yourself?

251
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,997
- I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.

252
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:19,086
It takes something, though, I mean just
to do that to yourself like he did. God!

253
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,342
Hey, you think I said something
made him mad?

254
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,344
(laughs)

255
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:30,556
- Well, what?
- Franklin, you're crazier than he was.

256
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,810
Hey, I got us some barbeque.

257
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:38,773
- Newt's the closest place to get gas.
- (Sally) Aw.

258
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,907
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place?
There's a creek. You could go swimming.

259
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,283
(Jerry) Let's go.

260
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,535
Come on, Sally.
We're going to Grandpa's place.

261
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,912
Let's go!

262
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:57,124
(Sally) Hey, that guy smeared blood
all over the van.

263
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:01,796
- Like he was trying to write something.
- (Franklin) What'd he do?

264
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,548
Did he write something on the van?

265
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,446
Let me see your knife.

266
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,451
Thank you.

267
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:42,420
Franklin, if we run out of gas
before we get back to that station,

268
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,423
you're towing us back in your chair.

269
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,842
(Sally laughs)

270
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:58,352
Hey, you think that guy's
just trying to scare us

271
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,814
by, you know,
blowing up my picture like that?

272
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,363
(Sally) Oh, I wish they hadn't
let the place fall apart.

273
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:55,451
(Kirk) It looks like the birth place
of Bela Lugosi.

274
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,578
- (Sally) I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.

275
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,789
- See that window over there?
- That's strange.

276
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,339
(Franklin) Hey, watch my arms.
Watch out.

277
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:12,176
- Be straight. Come on. Hey.
- I'll get you from here.

278
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,388
(Franklin) I want to see that smear
that guy made.

279
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:25,940
- Oh, man.
- Weird. I wonder if that means something.

280
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,025
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.

281
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,027
- Come on.
- Why don't you wash it off?

282
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,530
I want to show you the inside.

283
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,324
- Jerry!
- OK.

284
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,662
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

285
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:43,415
- Come on, Kirk.
- Here, man, you wash it off.

286
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,210
You don't think that guy would try
and follow us?

287
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:48,546
What for?

288
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,892
Where's my knife? Kirk?

289
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,144
(Sally laughs)

290
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,273
It looks like it must've been a nursery.

291
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:11,068
This is my room. I got to stay here one time
when I was eight years old.

292
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,029
- Right after my grandmother died.
- What happened?

293
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,366
- What happened to my grandmother?
- Yeah. She died.

294
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,372
(girls laughing)

295
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,762
(skittering sound)

296
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:45,394
(talking and laughing)

297
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,695
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- It's seen better days.

298
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,573
These animals used to talk me to sleep
when I was little.

299
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,993
Look at the zebras.
I had these fascination for the zebras.

300
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,538
Sally!

301
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,881
(grunting)

302
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,067
Sally!

303
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:25,119
(laughing)

304
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,248
Hee-hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee-hee.

305
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,668
Hee-hee-hee-hee.

306
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,508
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.

307
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:44,513
(mimicking) Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.

308
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:57,818
If I have any more fun today,
I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.

309
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,532
Aah! Ah!

310
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,659
(sobs)

311
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:10,372
(raspberries)

312
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,793
(laughing)

313
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,840
- Hey, Franklin.
- Hey, Franklin. What's wrong?

314
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,135
You said there was a swimming hole
around here?

315
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,720
Yeah.

316
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,183
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming,
man.

317
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:35,814
Uh, there used to be a trail
down between those two old sheds.

318
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,900
Come on, we'll find it.

319
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:45,282
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- (Kirk) No. We'll see you in an hour or so.

320
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:50,704
Yeah.
We'll see you in about an hour or so.

321
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:58,212
(rattling sound)

322
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:15,229
Sally?

323
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,443
Sally!

324
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,289
Zero in the world.

325
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,252
Just shoot him
and put us out of our misery.

326
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,339
- Snakes and spiders!
- Stop it!

327
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,717
And scorpions! Man-eating lizards.

328
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,475
- Kirk, help. Kirk!
- Ow. Ow.

329
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,060
Oh.

330
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,771
Crap.

331
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,569
This must be it.

332
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,196
Oh, are you OK?

333
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,533
How the hell did Franklin
ever get down here, anyway?

334
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:13,370
Somebody must've carried him
when he was little.

335
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,789
Franklin never was little.

336
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,294
(motor sound)

337
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,092
Gasoline.

338
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:32,514
I can leave him my guitar, give him a
couple bucks. We're coming back anyway.

339
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,143
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple
more dollars and bring him some gas.

340
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,313
They don't want your guitar.
They won't want to sell us gas.

341
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,773
Let's just go back now.

342
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,859
Hey, come here.

343
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,986
Come here and look at this.

344
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,555
- A generator.
- What?

345
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,600
A generator! For electricity.

346
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,523
Hey, hello in there! Is anybody here?

347
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:48,984
(knocking on door)

348
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,111
Hello, is anybody home?

349
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,885
I got something for you.

350
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,015
Ah!

351
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,099
Ooh!

352
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,977
Let's go!

353
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:40,869
Hello?

354
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,456
- Hey, Pam, come look at this.
- What? No!

355
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,337
Hello?

356
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,759
Is anybody home?

357
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,261
Hello?

358
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,013
(knocking)

359
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:07,145
(sound of pig squealing)

360
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,650
Hey, Pam.

361
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,113
(sound of pig squealing)

362
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,158
Hello?

363
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,016
Kirk?

364
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,282
Kirk!

365
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:20,927
Kirk?

366
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,411
Kirk.

367
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,706
(rustling)

368
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,291
Kirk?

369
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:59,841
(rustling)

370
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,593
Kirk?

371
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,975
(chicken clucking)

372
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,448
(coughs and retches)

373
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,996
Oh! Oh, God!

374
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,873
(cries)

375
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:04,549
Kirk! Kirk!

376
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,177
(man screaming)

377
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:09,179
(Pam screaming)

378
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:53,431
(chainsaw motor whirs)

379
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,870
(screaming)

380
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,717
(Jerry) He's gonna get you, Franklin.

381
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:34,597
- You don't think it means anything?
- (Sally) We'll protect you.

382
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,560
- I'll bet it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.

383
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,357
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh?
- You worry too much.

384
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,112
He couldn't find us anyway.
I mean, he doesn't even know our names.

385
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,739
I gave him your name.
I told him where you live.

386
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,451
I even gave him your zip code.
He's gonna kill you.

387
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,119
Jerry.

388
00:40:57,246 --> 00:41:00,457
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.

389
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,835
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife.

390
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,004
When did you have it last?

391
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:10,967
Well, I didn't have it last.
You had it last.

392
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,636
I gave it to you. Remember?
What did you do with it?

393
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,139
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?

394
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,309
No. I didn't have it
when I got out of the van.

395
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:24,147
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right, I'll look for it.

396
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:28,693
I think I'll walk down to the creek
before it gets too dark. How do I get there?

397
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:33,198
Well, there's a trail down there
between them two old sheds.

398
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,534
- Can I go, too?
- I think you'd better stay here.

399
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,662
All right.

400
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,297
I can't find it.

401
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,015
Are you mad at me?

402
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,601
No, I'm not mad at you.

403
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,940
You really are mad, huh?

404
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,944
Oh, I don't blame you.

405
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,278
I'm...

406
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,155
Kirk!

407
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,919
You really didn't want me to come,
did you?

408
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:31,297
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.

409
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,591
It's been a long day.

410
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,223
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff

411
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:45,061
that Pam was telling about
Saturn and retrograde and all that?

412
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:49,482
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.

413
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,025
Yeah.

414
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,074
You don't think that guy
would try and follow us, do you?

415
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,786
Well, I mean, there's no way
that he could follow us.

416
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,209
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.

417
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,883
Sally?

418
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,052
What now?

419
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,057
Nothing.

420
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,562
Never mind.

421
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,402
Kirk!

422
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,892
Hello?

423
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,898
Is anybody home?

424
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,488
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.

425
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,073
Hello?

426
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,246
Is anybody here?

427
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,918
Damn.

428
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,018
(chicken clucks)

429
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,436
Kirk?

430
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,483
- Are you guys in there?
- (person chuckles)

431
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:01,030
Hey, guys, quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.

432
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,830
(person laughing)

433
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,624
Pam, is that you?

434
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:14,460
(person laughing)

435
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,463
OK, you guys.

436
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,928
Come on out. Come on!

437
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,231
(knocking)

438
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,816
Kirk?

439
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:52,540
(knocking)

440
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,010
- (man yells)
- (Jerry screams)

441
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,901
(yelling)

442
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,787
(chicken clucking)

443
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,927
(honking)

444
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,939
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.

445
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:43,317
If they're not back in a minute,
we've got to go look for them.

446
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,903
Well, what if we get lost, too?

447
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,366
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station
and get help.

448
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,452
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.

449
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,164
(Sally) Jerry!

450
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,835
Jerry!

451
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,337
(Franklin) Jerry!

452
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:08,342
Jerry!

453
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:11,596
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

454
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,140
Hey!

455
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,606
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.

456
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,068
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.

457
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,364
Sally?

458
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,076
I think we ought to go.

459
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,162
(Sally sighs)

460
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:39,498
Are the keys in the van?

461
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:46,172
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
- What for?

462
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,884
Let me see the flashlight. I'll go
look for them. You don't have to go.

463
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,720
Sally, don't go.
I don't think that's a good idea.

464
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:58,017
I don't think you ought to go.
I'm going to honk the horn one more time.

465
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,102
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No.

466
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:04,565
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn,
and we're gonna wait a minute,

467
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,443
and then if they don't come, we'll go.

468
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,528
All right?

469
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,454
Sally, they took the keys.
We don't have any keys.

470
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,415
- They took the keys with them.
- (honking)

471
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,336
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Franklin!

472
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:28,422
- Jerry took the keys with him!
- Give me that flashlight!

473
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,885
No, Sally, we can't go! Look, what if
they came back and we weren't here?

474
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:36,847
- Give me that flashlight!
- No, I've got to take the flashlight.

475
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:41,560
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right, all right, I'll go with you.

476
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:45,606
No, Sally. Come on, I'll go with you,
but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.

477
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,359
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.

478
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:51,529
I can't push you down that hill!

479
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:55,491
Sally, look, I know. Oh!

480
00:49:55,575 --> 00:50:00,246
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold...
- Never mind, I'll just go without it.

481
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:06,544
All right, all right. Sally, wait!
Sally, wait a minute! I'm coming with you.

482
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,755
Sally? Hold up a minute now.

483
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,841
All right, let's go.

484
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,010
Let's go. I'll go with you.

485
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,930
Sally, I can't keep up with you.

486
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,016
Sally?

487
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,268
Sally, wait a minute.

488
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,691
(Franklin whimpers)

489
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,776
Hold up.

490
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,747
(Franklin) Jerry!

491
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:54,091
(Sally) Jerry!

492
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,219
Jerry!

493
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:01,724
(both) Jerry!

494
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,482
(Franklin) Wait.

495
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,903
- I thought I heard something.
- There's a light.

496
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,988
- Yeah?
- Yes.

497
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:20,576
(Sally) Oh, it looks like a house.

498
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,954
Well, come on, push.
Come on, push.

499
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,540
Push down. There. (grunts)

500
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:36,383
- (Sally) It's a house.
- Yeah? I can't see it very well.

501
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,720
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.

502
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,723
Come on, Sally.

503
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:45,601
Get back and push down.

504
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,728
This is impossible.

505
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,942
I hear something out there.

506
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,820
Look.

507
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,617
- (Franklin) Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!

508
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,744
(Franklin) Jerry!

509
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,629
Sally, I hear something.
Stop. Stop.

510
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,714
(sound of chainsaw)

511
00:52:15,799 --> 00:54:11,956
(screaming)

512
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,340
Somebody, please!

513
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,968
Help!

514
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,429
Help me, please!

515
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,518
Somebody, help me!

516
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:45,781
(screaming)

517
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:10,306
Help!

518
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,891
Please! Please! Please help me!

519
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,060
Please!

520
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:23,277
(screams)

521
00:55:39,085 --> 00:57:31,405
(screaming)

522
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,922
Help! Help me!

523
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,591
Help!

524
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,888
Help! Help!

525
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,264
Help!

526
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:01,977
Help! Help me!

527
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,272
Help me! Oh, God!
Help, help!

528
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,150
Close the door. Help me.

529
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,777
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.

530
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:13,655
- Come over here.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.

531
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,575
Help, help...

532
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,161
Calm down. You're all right, you're OK.

533
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,788
- Oh, now, take it easy.
- Call the police.

534
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:24,041
- He might come.
- Now, what happened?

535
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:28,128
- He... he... he killed...
- Now, now, take it easy.

536
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:31,173
He killed Franklin.
I don't know. Call the police!

537
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:34,551
- Take it easy.
- And Jerry.

538
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,971
I... I don't-I don't know
what happened to the others.

539
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,265
There's nobody out there now.

540
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,268
Come on. Come on now, take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.

541
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,021
- Oh, please.
- What happened?

542
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,691
Please. Call the police.

543
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:52,778
There's no phone here.

544
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:57,533
We... we have to drive over to Childress.

545
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,202
Yeah, yeah.
Now, you take it easy.

546
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,205
Take it easy now. I'll get the truck.

547
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,041
- Now, now, take it easy. Take it easy.
- Don't go.

548
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:08,544
Take it easy.

549
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:20,180
(radio announcer) Weather is expected to
be warm to partly cloudy tomorrow

550
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,683
with no chance of precipitation.

551
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:26,436
The high today will be in the upper 90s
and a low tonight of 81 degrees.

552
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:30,566
Current temperature is 96 with winds
out the southeast at three miles a hour.

553
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:34,361
Humidity 98,
barometer is at 29.9 and rising.

554
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:38,532
Acting on a tip,
the Muerto County sheriff's office

555
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:42,619
began an investigation early this morning
in the Muerto County Cemetery

556
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,914
opening crypts where there was
evidence of tampering.

557
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:51,003
The sheriff's deputies found a reported
dozen coffins robbed of their contents.

558
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,754
According to the sheriff,

559
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:56,550
there were cadavers in which the heads
and extremities were removed,

560
00:59:56,634 --> 01:00:01,513
and others in which only a hand or foot
had been removed.

561
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,433
Maldonado has information
linking the robberies

562
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:08,437
to a large and well-organized
West Coast jewel theft ring

563
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:13,609
but declined to suggest any reason
for them to mutilate the cadavers.

564
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:17,195
(news report continues indistinct)

565
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,868
(Sally crying and gasping)

566
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:36,798
- What are you doing?
- You ain't got no need to worry.

567
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,924
No!

568
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:41,970
You just cooperate, young lady,
and we'll have no trouble.

569
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,766
- Now, listen...
- What do you want?

570
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:51,355
Now, there's no need to do that.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

571
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:52,898
No!

572
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,775
(screaming)

573
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:07,913
(man laughs)

574
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,165
No! No! No!

575
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,876
(screams)

576
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,254
(stops screaming)

577
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,983
(Sally groans)

578
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,046
(starts engine)

579
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:43,049
(turns off engine)

580
01:02:58,483 --> 01:02:59,441
(chuckles)

581
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:01,735
Had to lock up and get the lights.

582
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:05,864
Cost of electricity is enough to
drive a man out of business.

583
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,408
(starts engine)

584
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,502
(Sally whimpers)

585
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,297
(muffled crying)

586
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,141
(muffled screaming)

587
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:37,938
Uh, I hope you're not
too uncomfortable down there.

588
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:40,023
(muffled screaming)

589
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:48,657
You got nothing to worry about. You just
take it easy, and we'll be there soon.

590
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,325
(laughs)

591
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,577
(muffled crying)

592
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,498
Now, now, now, now.

593
01:03:56,582 --> 01:03:59,751
There's no need to do that, no.

594
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:13,807
(Sally whimpering)

595
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:22,941
(laughing)

596
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,823
We'll be over this in a bit.

597
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,868
Hang on.

598
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,086
Halfwits.

599
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:51,136
Little coon shits.

600
01:04:58,185 --> 01:05:01,730
- Come here, you nap-haired idiot!
- (grunts)

601
01:05:01,814 --> 01:05:04,900
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.

602
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:08,945
You damn fool,
you almost got caught over at Duke's.

603
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:12,115
No, no, they didn't see me.
They don't know nothing.

604
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:15,744
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!

605
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:29,382
(starts engine)

606
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:58,078
I told you and I told you,

607
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,957
I told you never to leave your brother alone,
you...

608
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:06,461
Get in there and get that girl out of the car.
Come on, get her out of the car.

609
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:10,382
- Get her out of there.
- (Sally screaming)

610
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:13,843
Hopefully your brother
didn't let any of those kids get away.

611
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,805
Get her in there.
We'll have the whole county out here.

612
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,391
Don't you got any self-respect?

613
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:25,146
Look what your brother did to the door!

614
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:28,149
He's got no pride in his home?

615
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,235
Get her in there.

616
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:38,576
You've been a fool, you!

617
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:42,122
You better get them other kids.

618
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,624
Where are they, huh?

619
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:55,093
(screaming)

620
01:06:56,762 --> 01:06:58,596
You're a damn fool, you.

621
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,893
- (screaming)
- (laughing)

622
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,437
Oh!

623
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,856
I thought you was in a hurry.

624
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,405
Where are the kids?
Where are they? Show me!

625
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:17,866
(Leatherface explaining)

626
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:23,079
- None of 'em get away?
- Uh-uh-uh.

627
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,790
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

628
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:32,047
You...

629
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:36,342
You damn fool! You ruined the door!

630
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,807
(screaming)

631
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:48,188
Hey, you did good. She's a nice girl.

632
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:52,400
You nitwit, get upstairs
and get your grandpa.

633
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:12,837
Now, now, young lady,
you just take it easy there now.

634
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:16,841
Look, we'll fix you some supper
in a few minutes. Huh?

635
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,721
Get back in there!

636
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,143
Get in there!

637
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:34,901
Now, you just take it easy.

638
01:08:34,985 --> 01:08:36,986
Take it easy.

639
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,657
We'll have you something to eat
right away.

640
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,726
Hey.

641
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,895
Hey, Leatherface.

642
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,356
Give me a hand with Grandpa.

643
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:30,623
Careful.

644
01:09:45,431 --> 01:09:48,016
(muffled cries)

645
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:10,788
Look, Grandpa, look, look.

646
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,901
Here, here!

647
01:10:51,121 --> 01:10:53,164
(screaming)

648
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:39,877
(flies buzzing)

649
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,547
(dishes and utensils clanking)

650
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,901
(screaming)

651
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,948
(howling)

652
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:26,966
Shut up!

653
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,801
Quiet!

654
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:31,596
You act like a pack of hounds.

655
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,265
We were just having fun.

656
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,642
You think this is a party?

657
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:38,936
Please.

658
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,440
You can make them stop.

659
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:44,817
No, he can't. (laughs)

660
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:47,320
Shut your mouths.

661
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:50,823
Can't be helped, young lady.

662
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:54,285
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me.
- Shut up.

663
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,412
Don't pay him no mind.

664
01:12:57,956 --> 01:13:00,041
(sobbing)

665
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:05,338
- You like this face?
- (screaming)

666
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,897
You're crazy!
You've got to make them stop!

667
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:24,941
Please!

668
01:13:25,025 --> 01:13:27,568
He's nothing. He's just the cook.

669
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:31,239
Shut up, you bitch hog.

670
01:13:32,950 --> 01:13:36,494
Me and Leatherface do all the work.
He don't like it.

671
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:38,955
Ain't that right?
You're just the cook!

672
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:41,916
Shut your mouth!

673
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,253
You don't understand nothing.

674
01:13:45,337 --> 01:13:49,048
I understand you ain't nothing.
Me and him do all the work!

675
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,968
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.

676
01:13:55,264 --> 01:14:00,560
Well, there's just some things you got
to do. Don't mean you have to like it.

677
01:14:00,644 --> 01:14:03,479
Oh, please. Please.

678
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,692
What do you want?
I'll do anything. Anything.

679
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:09,527
(laughs)

680
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:13,698
I'll do... I'll do anything you want.

681
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,584
(Sally continues screaming)

682
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,181
Don't need to torture the poor girl.

683
01:15:20,265 --> 01:15:24,560
You just shut up! Remember you're just
the cook, and me and him will handle this.

684
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,730
Then get on with it.
I won't have this.

685
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:34,695
We ain't in no hurry
because you ain't going no place.

686
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:36,531
No.

687
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:40,201
You hear me?
It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.

688
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:45,665
No sense in waiting.

689
01:15:45,749 --> 01:15:47,917
I got to open up the room.

690
01:15:48,877 --> 01:15:54,006
I been... I been thinking about
letting Grandpa have some fun.

691
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:56,300
You always said he's the best.

692
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:58,386
He's the best, all right.

693
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:04,684
Let's let him have a whack. Hey, Grandpa,
we going to let you have this one.

694
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:16,612
Just let him have a whack.

695
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:23,786
Now, you just hush.
It won't hurt none.

696
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:29,250
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer
there ever was.

697
01:16:29,334 --> 01:16:32,878
Why, it never took more than one lick,
they say.

698
01:16:32,963 --> 01:16:36,173
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.

699
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:39,635
They say he could've done more
if the hook and pull gang

700
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,556
could've gotten the beeves
out of the way faster.

701
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:46,684
Now, now, don't you cry none.

702
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,437
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.

703
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:52,940
(screams)

704
01:16:53,025 --> 01:16:55,443
No! No!

705
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,364
(screams)

706
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:05,328
No! No!

707
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:09,457
No! Oh, please don't!

708
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:12,918
Please! Please! Please don't!

709
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,212
No, no! No!

710
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,381
(screaming)

711
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:26,724
No!

712
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:30,436
Hit her, Grandpa!

713
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,605
(screaming)

714
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:37,068
Hit her, Grandpa!

715
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:39,654
Hit her! Come on, Grandpa.

716
01:17:41,698 --> 01:17:43,699
Hit her!

717
01:17:44,743 --> 01:17:47,119
Hit that bitch.

718
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:49,872
Hit her, Grandpa!

719
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:52,833
Come on!

720
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,172
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.

721
01:17:58,256 --> 01:18:01,676
Careful there. Come on, Grandpa.

722
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:05,179
Get her Grandpa, get her.

723
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:08,182
Go ahead, go ahead! Get her!

724
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:22,196
Come on.

725
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,825
- Give me the hammer. I'll get her.
- Get her, get her, Grandpa.

726
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:29,203
- Give me that hammer.
- Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.

727
01:18:29,287 --> 01:18:32,164
- I'll kill her. Let me get her.
- Hit the bitch.

728
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,317
(chainsaw sound)

729
01:19:02,946 --> 01:19:15,499
(screaming)

730
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,196
(truck horn)

731
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:56,457
(screams) Help!

732
01:19:56,541 --> 01:19:58,209
(screaming)

733
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,501
(screams)

734
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:56,141
Help!

735
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:18,789
Go!

736
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,125
Go

737
01:21:22,794 --> 01:21:24,837
(screams)
