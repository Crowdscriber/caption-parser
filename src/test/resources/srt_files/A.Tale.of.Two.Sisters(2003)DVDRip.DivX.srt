1
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:25,200
How was your day today?
How was it?

2
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:36,213
Well then, shall we talk?

3
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,311
First, tell me about yourself

4
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,722
Who do you think you are?

5
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,571
Do you know who this is?

6
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,779
Don't know?

7
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,581
It's your family

8
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,684
Want to see it again?

9
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,295
Fine then

10
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:34,705
Can you tell me

11
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,207
about that day?

12
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,614
About what happened?

13
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,719
You should be able
to remember it clearly

14
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,219
It's okay

15
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,964
From now on

16
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:05,969
tell me what happened

17
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,442
Aren't you getting out?

18
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:00,230
Su-yeon

19
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,535
Su-yeon!

20
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,190
It's so pretty

21
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,521
Give me your hand

22
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,526
The other one

23
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,736
Why?

24
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,555
Su-mi!

25
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,882
Welcome home!

26
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,287
It's been such a long time

27
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,188
You've changed
so much, Su-yeon

28
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,386
You've gotten prettier...

29
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,494
But you two
really disappointed me

30
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,792
I waited all day for you two

31
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,595
cooking and cleaning the house

32
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,704
but why didn't
you say hi first?

33
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,897
What did you do?

34
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,803
Were you at the wharf?

35
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:26,110
You should've changed first
before you went outside

36
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,304
Anyway

37
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,512
welcome back home

38
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,933
Is something wrong?

39
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,038
I see you've gotten better

40
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,277
I'm so glad
you feel better now

41
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,179
You're taking after your mom

42
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:11,888
You're feeling
a lot better too, right?

43
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,794
Right
I bet you're both tired

44
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,091
Get some rest
and come down for dinner

45
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,200
I'm preparing a
special dinner

46
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,700
But, you should
give me some time

47
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,897
There's a lot to prepare

48
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,098
We just got back

49
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:48,504
Things don't look
so good right now

50
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,510
It wouldn't help much
if you came

51
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:57,113
Yeah, I know

52
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,343
Let's talk later
I should go

53
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,152
So you're doing okay, right?

54
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,759
Did I tell you?

55
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,362
Sun-kyu and his wife
are coming over

56
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,558
lt'll be alright
I'll take care of it

57
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,865
Okay, bye

58
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:17,853
Oh right!

59
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,361
I invited Sun-kyu and his wife over

60
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,763
for dinner this weekend

61
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:24,960
Really?

62
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,868
Lt'll be nice for them to
see the girls after so long

63
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,372
And to catch up on things

64
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,877
That was delicious

65
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:41,884
Sorry, I have things to tend to

66
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,686
You must be tired
so clean it up tomorrow

67
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:04,337
Did you prepare
your father's undergarments?

68
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,039
Thanks, but that's my job

69
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,843
Cleaning my room is my job, too
Why'd you touch my stuff?

70
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,544
That's how it was before

71
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,349
So all of the same clothes
were hanging there before?

72
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:43,576
I'm not having
dinner with him

73
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,273
What?

74
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,686
I said I'm not having
dinner with that guy

75
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,187
He's not some guy
he's your uncle

76
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,395
It's the first day
so let's give it a rest

77
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:12,542
- And you?
- Yes?

78
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:18,205
Aren't you going to follow her?
You're supposed to follow your sister

79
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,048
What did that woman tell you?

80
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,255
If she ever gets on your case
then tell me

81
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,282
And don't ignore it like before
Okay?

82
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,097
Good night

83
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,200
What's wrong?

84
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,408
Did you have a bad dream?

85
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,608
Was it the closet?

86
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,212
Then what's wrong?

87
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:05,445
I keep hearing
strange noises outside

88
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,755
It's because
you've been away too long

89
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,962
It's okay
Let's sleep

90
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:23,473
Somebody came into my room

91
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,191
He's asleep

92
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,834
- I know
- Then why are you trying to wake him?

93
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:03,838
Says who?

94
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,437
You were trying
to wake him just now

95
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,445
Have something to tell him?

96
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,142
It's none of your business

97
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,753
All I'm saying is
since his fast asleep

98
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,254
Don't wake him up
Don't you understand me?

99
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,551
I just came down for water

100
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,263
He's asleep so be quiet

101
00:30:51,382 --> 00:30:53,748
Did you go to my room?

102
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,845
Yes

103
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,288
Who was it?

104
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,292
That woman

105
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:10,497
Stepmom?

106
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:13,701
Yeah

107
00:31:18,843 --> 00:31:23,906
It's strange

108
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,510
What is?

109
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:32,616
That woman is strange

110
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,118
And so is this house

111
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:46,136
Are you scared?

112
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:55,242
Everything's alright
I'm here

113
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,641
Come here
Let's sleep

114
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:11,989
I'll always be with you

115
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,022
Su-yeon Go away

116
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,677
Are you awake?

117
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,570
Yes

118
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,279
- Can I come in?
- No

119
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,081
Come down and eat

120
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,652
What are you doing?

121
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,963
Are you having your period?

122
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,367
No, Su-yeon is...

123
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,874
Su-yeon?

124
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,573
That's so funny

125
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:53,789
How could we both get our periods
on the same date?

126
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,121
Su-mi...

127
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:27,121
It's okay, come down

128
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,715
That's mom's favorite, huh?

129
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,124
Do it like this

130
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,235
Shall we kill them?

131
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:51,932
Let's set them free

132
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,941
She'll have a cow
if we mess with her precious

133
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,276
I'd hate to see that

134
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,086
Su-mi

135
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,805
What are you doing
out in the cold?

136
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,706
Are you alright?

137
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,011
Why?

138
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:32,411
You don't look so good
Are you feeling sick?

139
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,715
No, I'm okay

140
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,013
Tell me what's wrong?

141
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:40,323
I said I'm okay

142
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,029
Just get rid of
Su-yeon's closet

143
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,933
Su-mi

144
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,526
we agreed not to talk about
that closet

145
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:58,138
You promised, right?

146
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,478
Su-mi

147
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:09,484
I know you're
very angry with me

148
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:16,422
And I know I'm a bad father

149
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,063
You're not even a bad father

150
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,600
It's cold so let's go inside

151
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,103
I will

152
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,887
What are you doing?

153
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:43,495
You scared me

154
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,093
When did you come in?

155
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,607
- Did you go to the warehouse?
- Yeah

156
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,252
Su-yeon, look at this

157
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:11,955
Tada!

158
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,562
Wow

159
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:14,959
- Cool
- Pretty, huh?

160
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:19,364
- Is it mom's?
- Yup, and...

161
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,471
There's more

162
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:26,769
It's mom!

163
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:33,474
Taritakoom, taritakoom

164
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:35,585
What does that mean?

165
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,085
It's a spell to call mom

166
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,485
Who told you that?

167
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,990
- Mom did
- What?

168
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:47,096
Can I take this?

169
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,893
Huh? Sure...

170
00:47:54,438 --> 00:47:59,102
This... and this

171
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:01,040
Wait!

172
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,840
What is this?

173
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:15,649
Who did this to you?

174
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,662
Tell me, who did this?

175
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,356
It's okay, tell me

176
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,464
She did this, huh?

177
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,069
She did this, didn't she?

178
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:33,164
Su-yeon
what's wrong with you?

179
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,778
I told you to
tell me everything!

180
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,880
She did this, right?

181
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,881
She did this, huh?
Did she do this?

182
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:43,578
Tell me! Tell me!
Tell me! Tell me!

183
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,253
What?

184
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:24,860
How can you be so cruel?

185
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:27,657
It's retribution

186
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,961
If you disobey
you need to be punished

187
00:49:31,101 --> 00:49:33,763
Does dad know what you did?

188
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,171
Think your father
can solve everything?

189
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:40,367
Then go get him
Want me to do it?

190
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,571
Sit down!
Where are your manners?

191
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,181
Were you like this
to your mom, too?

192
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,180
Don't bring up my mom!

193
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:51,187
Listen carefully
I'm your mother, got it?

194
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,879
As much as you hate it

195
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:54,684
I'm the only one in this world

196
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:57,487
you can call mother, got it?

197
00:49:57,627 --> 00:49:59,754
Crying over your mom's photos

198
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:01,694
won't change anything

199
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,891
Hard to handle, huh?
That's too bad

200
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,899
But that's how the world is

201
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:09,597
The world isn't as sweet
as you picture it

202
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:12,004
Sometimes you have to bear the worst
and live on

203
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:14,804
Like the way
I'm bearing you two!

204
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,605
Tough isn't it?

205
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:17,611
I have beared you two brats

206
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,911
from the moment I came to this house

207
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:22,313
I have never met such ill-mannered

208
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,920
menaces like you two

209
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:35,725
What?

210
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:40,331
Why the hell did
you even come here?

211
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,043
I can't believe you
said that to me again

212
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:53,145
I see, you still must be sick

213
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,415
Don't touch me

214
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,326
- Let go!
- What's wrong with you?

215
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,335
Are you that clueless?

216
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,440
Don't touch me
with those filthy hands!

217
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,132
Su-mi, listen to me

218
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,334
I don't want to hear it
You're the same

219
00:51:54,478 --> 00:51:56,446
That's not true
you've misunderstood

220
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,048
You're not even
accepting all this

221
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:00,979
Why is it always me?

222
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,985
Why are you asking only me
to understand?

223
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,887
Are you really clueless?

224
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,293
Yeah,

225
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,191
Maybe I don't know
I don't have all the answers

226
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,197
I don't know, so tell me
and let it off your chest

227
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,891
Tell me!

228
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,800
Will it change anything?
Will it?

229
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,807
Su-mi

230
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:32,006
Don't do this
Please don't

231
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:35,409
You'll get sick again

232
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,614
What?

233
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,327
Fine

234
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,331
From now on
anything that happens here

235
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:02,977
all the filthy things
you brought here

236
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:06,673
be responsible for it all

237
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:15,289
I have nothing more to say
so answer the phone

238
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,296
Do you remember?

239
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,602
My memory's a bit blurry
but I think it did happen

240
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,210
When was it?

241
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,005
Hey, remember this?

242
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:44,909
You jumped into the rive

243
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:47,312
to catch some fish

244
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:49,619
Then you started to drown

245
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,517
and everyone had a fit

246
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,726
There was another funny story

247
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:01,058
What was it?
Oh yeah, I remember

248
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,757
Remember that crazy guy?

249
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,163
The funny thing is
is that he was always normal

250
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,171
but whenever it rained
he went nuts

251
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,269
While plowing the field

252
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,775
he'd strip off his clothes
when it rained

253
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:18,278
and run out into the highway

254
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:21,677
The funniest time was

255
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,186
when it rained off and on

256
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:29,088
So he'd put on and take off
his clothes, again and again

257
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:35,091
Then he got sick of it
and just went into his house

258
00:55:38,228 --> 00:55:42,995
Everyone in the neighborhood
laughed so much back then

259
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:44,191
But when...

260
00:55:44,335 --> 00:55:47,702
But when he was little
he saw him doing that once

261
00:55:47,838 --> 00:55:51,205
He saw him doing that once
and then he ran together

262
00:55:51,342 --> 00:55:53,606
with that crazy guy

263
00:55:57,147 --> 00:56:00,844
Our mom saw that
and she almost passed out

264
00:56:01,185 --> 00:56:03,346
Do you remember?

265
00:56:03,687 --> 00:56:05,746
You remember, right?

266
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:09,859
Say something

267
00:56:09,993 --> 00:56:11,858
Don't you remember?

268
00:56:12,296 --> 00:56:16,756
You remember, right?

269
00:56:21,205 --> 00:56:23,070
No

270
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:24,674
I don't remember

271
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:27,677
What?

272
00:56:32,015 --> 00:56:35,576
I said I don't remember

273
00:56:59,042 --> 00:57:01,033
Why don't you remember?

274
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:10,649
Are you crazy?

275
00:57:39,716 --> 00:57:40,683
Mi-hee!

276
00:57:47,724 --> 00:57:49,157
Mi-hee!

277
00:57:50,327 --> 00:57:51,692
Wait, hold on to her

278
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:53,592
- What's wrong?
- Wake up!

279
00:57:55,732 --> 00:57:57,199
Bring some water

280
00:57:57,334 --> 00:57:58,699
Are you alright, Mi-hee?

281
00:58:01,772 --> 00:58:03,137
Water, water

282
00:58:31,101 --> 00:58:33,069
I'm sorry, it's all my fault

283
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:46,882
Mi-hee!

284
00:58:47,217 --> 00:58:48,582
It's okay

285
00:58:54,525 --> 00:58:57,494
It's alright, Mi-hee

286
00:58:58,128 --> 00:59:00,028
It's alright

287
00:59:40,304 --> 00:59:42,670
I'm sorry

288
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:47,811
I didn't want to come
but your father begged me to

289
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:50,109
so I had no choice

290
00:59:50,814 --> 00:59:53,578
- Honey
- Yes?

291
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:58,084
I saw something strange
in that house

292
00:59:58,221 --> 01:00:00,781
What did you see?

293
01:00:00,924 --> 01:00:04,382
There was a girl
under the sink

294
01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:27,214
Just go in

295
01:04:15,011 --> 01:04:18,777
- Can't you just stay here?
- Why?

296
01:04:19,115 --> 01:04:20,980
It's strange

297
01:04:21,218 --> 01:04:23,277
What's strange?

298
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,283
It's strange

299
01:04:25,822 --> 01:04:28,086
After the girls came down

300
01:04:28,225 --> 01:04:30,887
weird things have been
happening in this house

301
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:34,290
Don't say stupid things

302
01:04:34,431 --> 01:04:36,695
Didn't you see it?

303
01:04:37,033 --> 01:04:41,493
You're just having a hard time adjusting
You'll get better if you rest

304
01:04:41,638 --> 01:04:43,503
No

305
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:49,808
There's something
in this house

306
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:57,311
I'll look around,
so lie down

307
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:16,149
Open the door!

308
01:07:16,292 --> 01:07:17,759
Open it!

309
01:07:18,795 --> 01:07:20,353
Open the god damn door!

310
01:07:27,704 --> 01:07:29,171
I'll show you

311
01:08:45,715 --> 01:08:47,376
Get up!

312
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,485
Get off the bed

313
01:08:55,325 --> 01:08:56,792
Get off now!

314
01:09:00,763 --> 01:09:02,731
I said now!

315
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:30,150
Come here, right now!

316
01:09:34,097 --> 01:09:35,860
You pest...

317
01:09:46,209 --> 01:09:47,574
Talk!

318
01:09:52,115 --> 01:09:55,482
A person can't get any rest
around this household

319
01:09:59,622 --> 01:10:03,080
Tell me
Who did it?

320
01:10:05,428 --> 01:10:06,793
Who did it?

321
01:10:08,231 --> 01:10:09,391
Who?
Better tell me the truth

322
01:10:09,532 --> 01:10:11,796
Who did it!

323
01:10:12,435 --> 01:10:14,198
Was it Su-mi?

324
01:10:15,738 --> 01:10:18,002
You two need
to learn a lesson!

325
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:20,006
Was it your sister?

326
01:10:38,161 --> 01:10:41,927
So do you feel better looking
at your dead mom's things?

327
01:10:42,065 --> 01:10:44,226
Feel happy
after seeing the photos?

328
01:11:09,726 --> 01:11:11,887
Say that you're sorry

329
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:15,493
Until you do, don't even
think about coming out

330
01:11:26,142 --> 01:11:27,803
There's no use in crying

331
01:11:27,944 --> 01:11:31,004
Say that you're sorry
and beg for forgiveness!

332
01:11:32,248 --> 01:11:34,614
I'm sorry

333
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:36,512
What?

334
01:11:36,953 --> 01:11:39,114
Say it right

335
01:11:40,456 --> 01:11:42,515
I'm sorry

336
01:11:52,268 --> 01:11:54,532
I'll ask you once more

337
01:11:56,773 --> 01:11:59,435
You're admitting
that you're sorry, right?

338
01:12:02,912 --> 01:12:04,470
Stop crying

339
01:12:05,515 --> 01:12:08,484
I don't want to hear it,
so stop it now!

340
01:12:13,022 --> 01:12:15,081
Are you...

341
01:12:15,224 --> 01:12:16,987
Are you mad?

342
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:21,085
Is that why you're crying?

343
01:12:25,835 --> 01:12:30,033
Fine, let's see
how long you hold up

344
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:35,108
This will put some sense
into you two

345
01:13:51,954 --> 01:13:53,615
Su-yeon

346
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:01,555
Su-yeon, I'm sorry

347
01:14:04,801 --> 01:14:07,269
I didn't hear you

348
01:14:11,007 --> 01:14:14,966
I'm sorry, Su-yeon
I'm sorry

349
01:14:21,317 --> 01:14:24,480
This won't happen again

350
01:14:25,822 --> 01:14:28,290
I promise

351
01:15:19,408 --> 01:15:22,275
Don't cry, it's okay

352
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,904
- Tell me
- What?

353
01:15:54,043 --> 01:15:56,204
Why the hell
are you doing this?

354
01:15:56,646 --> 01:15:59,809
Tell me why you've acted

355
01:15:59,949 --> 01:16:02,850
so weird since you got here

356
01:16:02,985 --> 01:16:04,543
You really don't know?

357
01:16:04,687 --> 01:16:06,848
Don't know what? What is it?

358
01:16:06,989 --> 01:16:08,854
I'm talking about
what that woman is doing to us!

359
01:16:08,991 --> 01:16:11,152
So tell me what has she done?

360
01:16:11,294 --> 01:16:13,455
She keeps harassing Su-yeon

361
01:16:16,499 --> 01:16:17,761
What?

362
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,959
Didn't you hear me?

363
01:16:20,703 --> 01:16:23,365
I said she keeps harassing Su-yeon!

364
01:16:23,506 --> 01:16:25,269
She's vicious, evil

365
01:16:25,408 --> 01:16:28,275
and always locks Su-yeon up
in the closet!

366
01:16:28,411 --> 01:16:30,879
Su-mi, please stop it

367
01:16:32,014 --> 01:16:33,982
Stop what?

368
01:16:34,817 --> 01:16:38,776
You know that
Su-yeon is scared of her

369
01:16:39,722 --> 01:16:43,385
Su-yeon, you tell dad

370
01:16:44,126 --> 01:16:46,788
Stop crying
and tell him now

371
01:16:46,929 --> 01:16:48,590
Tell him!

372
01:16:48,731 --> 01:16:50,699
Please stop it!

373
01:16:55,838 --> 01:16:58,204
Su-yeon... is dead

374
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:05,138
What?

375
01:17:08,184 --> 01:17:10,152
No...

376
01:17:11,187 --> 01:17:15,556
Su-yeon is dead

377
01:17:16,092 --> 01:17:19,061
So pull yourself together

378
01:17:29,005 --> 01:17:32,668
How long will you keep this up?

379
01:17:41,617 --> 01:17:43,676
It's not true, Su-yeon

380
01:17:46,422 --> 01:17:48,686
Su-yeon...

381
01:17:57,033 --> 01:17:59,194
Su-yeon No... No...

382
01:18:26,495 --> 01:18:29,953
Come down tomorrow,
I can't do it alone

383
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,065
Hmm...

384
01:18:34,303 --> 01:18:36,965
She's getting worse

385
01:18:39,208 --> 01:18:43,611
I'll pick you up
call me when you get here

386
01:20:24,246 --> 01:20:25,611
Su-yeon!

387
01:20:26,448 --> 01:20:27,915
Su-yeon!

388
01:20:28,851 --> 01:20:30,409
Su-yeon!

389
01:21:08,324 --> 01:21:10,292
- Su-mi!
- Su-yeon!

390
01:23:41,877 --> 01:23:43,174
Su-yeon!

391
01:26:43,425 --> 01:26:44,392
Su-yeon!

392
01:26:44,927 --> 01:26:46,087
Su-yeon!

393
01:26:53,535 --> 01:26:57,596
I am fed up with your family

394
01:29:01,263 --> 01:29:06,826
How did we come to this?

395
01:29:14,176 --> 01:29:16,736
Don't you get it yet?

396
01:29:20,182 --> 01:29:23,549
Remember what
I told you before?

397
01:29:24,786 --> 01:29:29,553
Remember when I said
you'll regret it some day?

398
01:29:36,598 --> 01:29:38,759
You...

399
01:29:40,001 --> 01:29:43,459
Know what's really scary?

400
01:29:44,706 --> 01:29:50,167
You want to forget something

401
01:29:51,513 --> 01:29:54,676
Totally wipe it off of your mind

402
01:29:56,818 --> 01:29:59,082
But you never can

403
01:29:59,221 --> 01:30:01,416
It can't go away, you see

404
01:30:02,824 --> 01:30:04,689
And...

405
01:30:05,727 --> 01:30:10,687
And it follows you around
like a ghost

406
01:30:14,436 --> 01:30:17,405
Help me

407
01:30:27,649 --> 01:30:32,313
Sure, I'll help you

408
01:30:33,255 --> 01:30:35,815
Let's end it here

409
01:31:21,036 --> 01:31:22,298
Su-mi!

410
01:31:23,238 --> 01:31:24,705
Su-mi!

411
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,703
Su-mi!

412
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:54,324
Where's Su-mi?

413
01:32:55,764 --> 01:32:57,629
Where?

414
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,862
Please stop it

415
01:33:01,803 --> 01:33:04,363
I'm sick of it now

416
01:33:11,713 --> 01:33:15,672
Take this
you'll feel much better

417
01:34:51,846 --> 01:34:53,507
Su-mi!

418
01:35:36,124 --> 01:35:37,989
Don't you get it yet?

419
01:35:38,126 --> 01:35:39,889
You're just having
a hard time adjusting

420
01:35:40,028 --> 01:35:41,188
You still must be sick

421
01:35:41,329 --> 01:35:42,796
You promised not to
bring up that closet

422
01:35:42,931 --> 01:35:44,990
How could we both get our periods
on the same date?

423
01:35:45,133 --> 01:35:46,600
Su-yeon is dead!

424
01:35:46,735 --> 01:35:48,202
No, I don't remember!

425
01:37:50,525 --> 01:37:52,993
Su-mi, are you okay?

426
01:38:02,804 --> 01:38:05,329
It's all over now

427
01:38:07,075 --> 01:38:09,839
You'll feel better here

428
01:38:16,384 --> 01:38:18,852
Get some rest

429
01:38:19,888 --> 01:38:22,550
I'll come and visit often

430
01:38:29,397 --> 01:38:33,265
Take care of yourself
Bye

431
01:38:39,207 --> 01:38:43,075
Su-mi, what's wrong?
Let go

432
01:38:44,412 --> 01:38:46,471
Let go, Su-mi

433
01:38:48,416 --> 01:38:51,579
Please stop it and let go

434
01:40:08,930 --> 01:40:11,694
- No, I'll get it
- Let me take one

435
01:41:50,364 --> 01:41:52,423
Mom...

436
01:42:14,021 --> 01:42:16,182
Su-yeon!

437
01:46:32,413 --> 01:46:33,311
Su-yeon!

438
01:47:27,201 --> 01:47:28,463
Mom?

439
01:47:29,603 --> 01:47:33,471
Mom? Mom, mom!

440
01:47:33,607 --> 01:47:39,375
Mom! Mom, mom, mom!

441
01:47:39,513 --> 01:47:40,673
Mom!

442
01:49:11,972 --> 01:49:14,236
Didn't you hear something?

443
01:49:16,877 --> 01:49:19,243
Why'd you come up here?

444
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:22,740
Dad's not here

445
01:49:23,984 --> 01:49:26,544
What do you mean by that?

446
01:49:26,987 --> 01:49:30,445
Now you're trying
to act like mom

447
01:49:33,294 --> 01:49:35,091
Do me a favor

448
01:49:35,296 --> 01:49:38,231
Stay out of our lives

449
01:49:43,704 --> 01:49:46,264
Can you get out of the way?

450
01:49:46,507 --> 01:49:48,975
I have to go

451
01:49:52,513 --> 01:49:54,174
You...

452
01:49:54,315 --> 01:49:56,875
You might regret this moment

453
01:49:57,017 --> 01:49:59,178
Keep that in mind!

454
01:50:02,923 --> 01:50:04,788
What can be worse

455
01:50:04,925 --> 01:50:07,086
than standing here with you?

456
01:50:09,530 --> 01:50:11,088
When you're here

457
01:50:11,231 --> 01:50:14,200
I wanna be as far away
from you as I can

458
01:50:14,635 --> 01:50:16,398
Understand?

459
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:31,213
Su-mi!

460
01:50:35,055 --> 01:50:36,716
Su-mi!

461
01:51:08,422 --> 01:51:10,788
Help me... Su-mi

462
01:51:10,924 --> 01:51:14,860
Su-mi... Su-mi...

463
01:51:16,430 --> 01:51:18,364
Su-mi... 
