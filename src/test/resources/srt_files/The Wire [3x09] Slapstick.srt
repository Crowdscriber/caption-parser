1
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:21,478
- Hello.
<i>- Hey, what're you doing?</i>

2
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:22,980
Oh, hi.

3
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:24,920
<i>- Are you sleeping?</i>
- No.

4
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:28,252
<i>- Oh, you're not happy to hear from me.</i>
- No, I'm glad you called.

5
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,555
<i>I wanna see you.</i>

6
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:33,431
- What, now?
<i>- Yes, now.</i>

7
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,093
- Where are you?
<i>- Same place as before.</i>

8
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:37,996
Peabody.

9
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:41,130
<i>- Are you sure you're not sleeping?</i>
- No, no, I was up.

10
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,710
<i>You liar. Come on, get your ass over here.</i>

11
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:48,542
<i>Yeah, okay. I mean, yeah, what the hell.</i>

12
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,343
<i>- Room 210.</i>
- Fine.

13
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,743
- Sean, Seanie.
- What?

14
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,278
I have to go out and see a friend
for a little bit.

15
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,610
I'll be gone for an hour or two, okay?

16
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,410
I put my cell phone on this slip of paper.

17
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,687
I'll put it on that top shelf, okay?

18
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,359
What did I just say?

19
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,259
You're going out to see a friend
and your number's on the top shelf.

20
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:38,330
Attaboy.

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,601
<i>The Kerry camp had an early opportunity</i>
<i>to capitalize on jobs and the economy...</i>

22
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,403
<i>as an issue,</i>
<i>and tag the President with it.</i>

23
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,944
<i>The pre-election polls show</i>
<i>that a significant number...</i>

24
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,741
<i>of undecided and persuadable voters...</i>

25
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,646
<i>thought Kerry over Bush</i>
<i>offered a better chance for jobs.</i>

26
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,809
<i>Jobs may have been</i>
<i>a marginal issue, Kate...</i>

27
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,353
<i>in some of the Rust Belt</i>
<i>battleground states.</i>

28
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:07,223
<i>But, ultimately, this was a referendum</i>
<i>on the leadership of George W. Bush...</i>

29
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:09,454
<i>on the war against terror</i>
<i>and the war in Iraq.</i>

30
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,756
You're so full of shit.

31
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,264
Nothing mattered in the red states
but the economy.

32
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,493
I've been saying that for months.

33
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,360
Hey, I'm not tossing you so quick tonight.
I got nothing to do tomorrow.

34
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,838
Well, I'm tossing myself.

35
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,002
I gotta get home.

36
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,072
You know what, not that this wasn't fun...

37
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:34,551
but it might be nice to have dinner first.
Dinner and a movie.

38
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,452
- I got to Baltimore late.
- No, I'm saying next time.

39
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:42,017
We talk some, then we fuck our brains out.
It's different for girls like me.

40
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,794
You need to be cuddled, McNulty?

41
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,027
No, but we make a date, I don't feel like
I have to charge by the hour.

42
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,625
A date, huh?

43
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,836
I'll call you.

44
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,337
In the daytime.

45
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,246
<i>I think we can all agree</i>
<i>that foreign policy and...</i>

46
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,665
<i>... while the United States was reeling</i>
<i>from the attack on Pearl Harbor...</i>

47
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:24,031
<i>... wonders of wood carving...</i>

48
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:28,939
<i>He wrapped himself in the American flag</i>
<i>at the convention and never looked back.</i>

49
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,033
<i>Come on, Kate, that's a little harsh,</i>
<i>don't you think?</i>

50
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,839
<i>No, I don't, I'm serious.</i>

51
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,972
<i>And I think it was great strategy</i>
<i>by his handlers, too.</i>

52
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,380
<i>You don't think that when John Kerry</i>
<i>kicked off... In his acceptance speech...</i>

53
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:43,148
<i>at the Democratic National Convention</i>
<i>he said, "I'm here under Old Glory"...</i>

54
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,417
<i>that he wasn't trying</i>
<i>to wrap himself in the flag, too?</i>

55
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:47,584
<i>No, I don't think he was trying</i>
<i>to wrap himself in the flag.</i>

56
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:50,458
<i>I think he was trying to defend the</i>
<i>people in the battleground states.</i>

57
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,655
<i>The ones who...</i>

58
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:59,371
<i>... 1942, the US 1st Marine Division</i>
<i>stormed the shore at Guadalcanal...</i>

59
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:03,240
<i>seizing a nearly complete airfield</i>
<i>at Lunga Point...</i>

60
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,504
<i>which was renamed Henderson Field...</i>

61
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,172
<i>and an anchorage at nearby Tulagi...</i>

62
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:11,114
<i>that would later be known</i>
<i>as Iron Bottom Sound...</i>

63
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,150
<i>because of the number of ships</i>
<i>sunk there in battle.</i>

64
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:17,455
<i>The landings of the first day</i>
<i>put nearly 11,000 Marines...</i>

65
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,991
<i>on the island. Minimal resistance...</i>

66
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,795
- Deep into it, I see.
- Yeah, we getting there.

67
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,299
You looking correct.

68
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,438
Sunday morning.
I'm on my way to hear the Word, you know?

69
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,505
You paying those guys out of pocket?

70
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,039
Boiler in there's working
and the pipes are okay.

71
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,744
I should have it all cleaned out
by tomorrow, I think.

72
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:28,984
All you gonna need is the permits.

73
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,459
- Permits?
- Yeah. Permits.

74
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,900
- Yo, was that him?
- Shit.

75
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,439
If it ain't, we'd only be wasting a bullet.

76
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,834
Only problem is it being Sunday
morning and all, you know?

77
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:58,010
- Who you calling?
- Slim Charles, man.

78
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:01,086
You told me we supposed to bring
our beefing before the group, right?

79
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,655
Here it is you warring
with the young boy, Marlo, over corners.

80
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,656
Marlo ain't in the group.

81
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,625
Be that as it may, all this shoot-em-up shit
is bad for business.

82
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,127
We got cops on half the West Side corners.

83
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:15,632
And what corner they ain't holding, I can't
have my people standing on for fear...

84
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:18,397
they gonna be mistaken as one
of Barksdale people and catch a bullet.

85
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,836
Look, man, I tried to talk to the
young buck myself, but...

86
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,932
You try talking to Avon.
Because that's half the problem right there.

87
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,510
No doubt, exactly.

88
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,600
- Yeah.
- That's it.

89
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:27,679
That's what I'm saying, man.

90
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:31,615
Nigga probably sleeping in.

91
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,819
Fact is, Stringer, your man
needs to reconcile himself...

92
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,260
to this new way of thinking.

93
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,499
Now, you could remind him that,
like everyone else in this room...

94
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,229
he benefiting from my connect
and from the wholesale price...

95
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,965
- we got by throwing in together.
- I mean, he know that, come on, Joe.

96
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,065
Well, so, now we coming to him for help
with a little something.

97
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,844
He need to just back the fuck off
and let the young gun keep his corners.

98
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,882
Now, you said yourself
it can't be about territory no more.

99
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,640
- Old habits die hard.
- Who this?

100
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:06,911
Yeah, it's me.

101
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,216
Yeah, we on the house where
the dude is, you <i>know...</i>

102
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,451
- Talk, nigga.
- Shit, man, I'm trying not to use names.

103
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,222
Look, this Gerard, man. And we're on Omar,
he gonna come out the house.

104
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,992
As you know, I ain't trying to lose
no niggas on them corners, either...

105
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,762
but it's a two-way street, you know?

106
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,859
Go ahead, man.

107
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,032
Gerard and Sapper
got their sights on Omar.

108
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,165
Tried to reach Slim and he ain't answering.

109
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,301
- So?
- It's church day, String.

110
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,901
Sunday morning, you know?

111
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,277
- They sure it's him?
- Omar, yeah.

112
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,443
All right, do it.

113
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:40,953
Do it.

114
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,154
Gerard. They right there, come on.

115
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,255
All right, here you go.

116
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,363
Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness!

117
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,113
This time, I definitely hit him.

118
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,675
District-wide, it's 14%.

119
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,853
A drop like that in the Western felony rate,
that's unheard of.

120
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,191
But God knows what happens
when you let go of your secret.

121
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,557
Hey, what happens, happens.

122
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,790
I mean, if they want to keep
my little experiment going...

123
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,163
or they want to go back to business
as usual. That's on them. But me?

124
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:33,063
I'm out of here, D, I'm gone.
And Hopkins came through.

125
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:35,436
I got a contract offer
on that security job yesterday.

126
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,907
- You really gonna retire?
- Always planned to.

127
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:45,984
What?

128
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,687
You started something.
You ain't gonna finish it?

129
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,484
- What do you mean?
- On a battlefield you can't do much...

130
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,857
to help anybody with anything.
But you managed a truce, Bunny.

131
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,864
And making the game street legal
takes the heart out of it.

132
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,957
Keep it going,
we gonna reach some of those people...

133
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:06,061
chasing dope and coke,
and maybe even some hoppers, too.

134
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,733
You might at that.

135
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:13,136
But what happens when you turn
your district over to the next man?

136
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:17,944
Or people get wind of this thing and
there's no one to defend it? What then?

137
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,414
- How's the contrast on that?
- Good for daylight.

138
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,490
Yeah?

139
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,791
On a Sunday? What the fuck, Lester?

140
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,891
Could say the same of you.

141
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,129
Elena's taking the kids to her mother's,
what the fuck else am I gonna do?

142
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,294
No life, no marriage, no kids.

143
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,800
No problem.

144
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,938
What's with the video?

145
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,705
Gonna put it up in one of the windows
across from Stringer's print shop.

146
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,174
Catch him coming and going.

147
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:51,009
- Hey, you need help?
- You're a known face.

148
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,684
I figure me and Prez do it on a Sunday,
shop is closed...

149
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:56,652
you know, looking like working men.

150
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,719
You know something, Lester? I do believe
there aren't five swinging dicks...

151
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,819
in this entire department
who can do what we do.

152
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,094
I'm not saying, like, all chest-out and shit.
It's just, I mean, you think about it...

153
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,469
there's maybe, what, 3,000 sworn, right?

154
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,233
Hundred or so are bosses,
so there's not a fucking clue there.

155
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,105
Few more hundred is
sergeants and lieutenants.

156
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,373
Most of them wanna be bosses one day,
so they're just as fucked.

157
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,439
Then there's 600 or 700
fucking housecats, you know?

158
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,384
Deskmen. And the patrol division?

159
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,617
There's probably a little bit of talent there,
but the way the city is right now...

160
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:37,059
that's 1,500 guys chasing calls
and clearing corners.

161
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,729
I mean, nobody's knowing his post,
nobody's building nothing, right?

162
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,625
And CID's the same.

163
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,600
Catching calls, chasing quick clearances,
keeping everything in the shallow end.

164
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,803
I mean, who is there out there,
can do what we can do with a case?

165
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:54,778
How many are there really?

166
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,743
Don Worden, Ed Burns,
Gary Childs out in the county...

167
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:02,377
John O'Neil and Steve Cleary
over at Woodlawn.

168
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,219
Oh, they bring it in, but there's not many.
There's not many.

169
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:11,061
We're good at this, Lester.
In this town, we're as good as it gets.

170
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,800
- Natural police.
- Fuck, yes, natural police.

171
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,403
Tell me something, Jimmy.
How exactly do you think it all ends?

172
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:26,339
- What do you mean?
- A parade? A golden watch?

173
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:31,042
A shining Jimmy-McNulty-Day moment
when you bring in a case...

174
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,641
so sweet everybody
gets together and says...

175
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:38,690
"Oh, shit, he was right all along.
We should've listened to the man."

176
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,485
The job will not save you, Jimmy.

177
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:46,991
It won't make you whole,
it won't fill your ass up.

178
00:12:47,733 --> 00:12:52,602
- I don't know. A good case...
- Ends. They all end.

179
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,069
The handcuffs go click and it's over...

180
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:59,042
and the next morning it's just
you in your room with yourself.

181
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:00,635
Until the next case.

182
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:04,079
Boy, you need something
outside of this here.

183
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,012
Like what? Dollhouse miniatures?

184
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,793
Hey, hey, hey. A life.
A life, Jimmy, you know what that is?

185
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,091
It's the shit that happens while you're
waiting for moments that never come.

186
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,139
- On a Sunday morning?
- We called to ask.

187
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,909
And Shamrock said to go.

188
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,781
On a Sunday morning,
y'all try to hit a nigga...

189
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,873
when he taking his
wrinkle-ass grandmas to pray.

190
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,518
And y'all don't hit the nigga, neither.

191
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,654
All y'all kill is grandma's crown?

192
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,589
And by the time Sham say go,
Omar damn near in the cab.

193
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,786
Ain't enough y'all done violated
the Sunday morning truce.

194
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:54,127
No! I'm standing here holding
a torn-up church crown...

195
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,428
of a bona fide colored lady.

196
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:01,206
Do you know what a colored lady is?
Not your moms, for sure.

197
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,171
'Cause if they was that...

198
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,073
y'all would've known better
than that bullshit.

199
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,580
Y'all trifling with Avon Barksdale
reputation here.

200
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:12,311
You know that?

201
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,245
Is she all right, though?

202
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:18,150
She got cut on her face from the glass
and she sore from where I fell on her.

203
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:19,315
But other than that, though.

204
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,286
You saved her ass, huh?

205
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,518
I damn near got that woman killed, yo.

206
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,989
Y'all should've seen me in Sinai Hospital
while they stitching her up...

207
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:29,863
lying about why somebody
wanna shoot me down in the street.

208
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,903
That woman think I work in a cafeteria.

209
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,131
- Cafeteria?
- At the airport, yeah.

210
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,400
The airport? Why the airport?

211
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,772
'Cause I know she ain't never gonna
go down there to go dining, that's why.

212
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,312
Hey, yo, Kimmy, this ain't funny, yo.
That woman raised me!

213
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:46,178
And, for as long as I been grown, once a
month I been with her on a church Sunday.

214
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,719
Telling myself ain't no need to worry
'cause there ain't nobody...

215
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:52,257
in this city that low-down
to disrespect a Sunday morning.

216
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,166
Y'all know I was gonna walk away, right?
Y'all know that, right?

217
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,065
I mean, after Tosha, I was
gonna leave them people be, yo.

218
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,899
- Avon home now.
- Oh, Barksdale got to go.

219
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:09,474
Stringer, too. This thing got to end, man!

220
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:15,043
I swear to God, yo, on a Sunday morning,
they near shot her best crown off, yo.

221
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:17,909
I mean, no shame, them niggas!
Man, y'all feel me?

222
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,379
I'm out.

223
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,851
If you back to dealing
with Barksdale people, I'm out, yo.

224
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:36,629
I'm in it for the money.
It's easier out there than that.

225
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,973
Just you and me then. Like it was.

226
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,682
No, yo. This one about me.

227
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,623
- And nobody else.
- Hey, I'm with you.

228
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:08,995
Not on this one, you ain't.

229
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,100
Okay, guys.

230
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,573
We are maybe a step and a half away
from being up on a wire on these people.

231
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,440
All we need is to firm up the PC...

232
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,777
showing the disposable phones
are being used in a drug conspiracy.

233
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,975
McNulty and Greggs, you're on that angle.

234
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,485
You need to walk either
an undercover or a wired CI...

235
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,884
up to one of the Barksdale crews.

236
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,890
Lester, you and Prez
start typing affidavits...

237
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,550
because when the probable cause
comes in...

238
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,026
we're gonna want to get
the application in fast.

239
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,890
Detective, you're the chaser
on our boy Bernard.

240
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,559
When he goes out for cell phones,
we're right behind.

241
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,329
The faster we get ahold
of the new numbers...

242
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,597
the faster we're up on those phones.

243
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,772
Now, when Caroline comes back
off vacation...

244
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:50,501
she's gonna be on the mini-cam.

245
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:54,177
From here on out we keep a log
on any movement by Stringer...

246
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,509
and we keep an eye out
for Mr. Barksdale as well.

247
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,776
Try to get a line
on where he spends his days.

248
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,853
As for me, I'm off to do battle
with the wireless company.

249
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,182
They a problem?

250
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,449
Have been since
the damn things were invented.

251
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,286
Okay, then.

252
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:10,885
Remember that with this wire,
everything is a race against the clock.

253
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,328
Anything we get up on is only temporary.

254
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:18,930
- You reach Bubbles?
- Yeah. He'll be waiting at Mount Clare.

255
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,973
- Lee, where's the DNR log?
- What?

256
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,433
The log.

257
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,571
Never mind, I got it right here.

258
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,645
All Stringer, all the time.

259
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:33,880
Theresa D'Agostino, please.

260
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:36,045
<i>- Can you hold, please?</i>
- Yeah, I'll hold.

261
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,617
<i>I'm sorry, she's not in the office now.</i>
<i>You wanna leave a message?</i>

262
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,386
No, I left one already.

263
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:01,479
- A boxing gym?
- For kids and all. An athletic club.

264
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,415
"Gyms, reducing salons, public baths are
permitted only in properties zoned...

265
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:10,113
"B2, B3, B4 or B5."

266
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,884
All signed and sealed
by a registered architect and <i>engineer...</i>

267
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,619
Floor framing plan,
including the load <i>criteria...</i>

268
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,354
Hydronic piping and equipment layouts.

269
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,522
Six copies of your fire protection plan...

270
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:22,259
with emergency exits
and sprinkler system noted.

271
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,927
Health Department since
it's a physical culture and health service.

272
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:28,234
A license from the State Athletic
Commission up on Calvert Street.

273
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,778
- Mid-size or full?
- Mid-size.

274
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:41,451
You should upgrade
and get one of them Escalades.

275
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:43,919
They got that XM radio and all.

276
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,552
I'm saying if we gonna be in that damn car
all damn day, it's worth it, Bernard.

277
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,955
- You ticklish, Bubs?
- The chills, Kima.

278
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,783
You do that to me.

279
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:25,260
Here's the buy money, Bubs.
Remember, this is all on tape.

280
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:26,388
I hear you.

281
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,661
So, down there on Vincent Street, they
don't even hide the ground stash anymore.

282
00:19:29,768 --> 00:19:32,396
You watch and wait,
see when they're running low...

283
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,932
and ask for 30 or so. Enough so that
they have to call for a quick re-up.

284
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,204
That's the important thing.
We want him to use his burner.

285
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,872
- All right. I get to keep the 30.
- Thirty'd kill you, Bubs.

286
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,539
You get to keep the money we hand you...

287
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,345
once you come back here
with all of that product.

288
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,318
- I was just asking.
- Just telling.

289
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,391
- It can't be done.
- Excuse me?

290
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,856
The activation information
you're gonna want?

291
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,490
That stuff's not accessible from the
business office until it goes to billing...

292
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,400
and that takes a few days,
sometimes a week or more.

293
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:11,169
But, more than that, we have dozens of
law enforcement inquiries every month.

294
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,110
We get to them in the order received
and currently the turnaround's 30 days.

295
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,442
Thirty days?

296
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:18,172
Let me understand something.

297
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,853
Your company is in business
selling disposable cell phones...

298
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,650
to people who don't have to give
any subscriber information...

299
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,849
- at the time of purchase, correct?
- Correct.

300
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,222
They buy these phones
and as far as you're concerned...

301
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:32,229
they use them anonymously,
pre-paying for their <i>minutes...</i>

302
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,593
From the retailers, yes.

303
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:37,396
And while they're using these phones
anonymously, for whatever purpose...

304
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:40,801
they can't be monitored by
law enforcement because your company...

305
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,966
can't react within a month
to a court order for a wiretap?

306
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,840
- We do the best we can.
- This is bullshit.

307
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,338
You're selling a phone that you know
is effective for drug trafficking.

308
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,782
Lieutenant, our prepaid inventory is there
for young people...

309
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,685
college students and such, people who
can't afford a permanent cell phone plan.

310
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,780
What college student
can't afford a cell phone?

311
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:03,122
They can afford the fucking college,
they can afford the phone that goes with it.

312
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,354
I resent the suggestion.

313
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:09,366
Just so I'm clear, you're telling me
that even if by some miracle we are able...

314
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:13,564
to get up on a drug dealer's disposable cell
phone in time to catch him talking...

315
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:16,766
you're gonna take as much as a month
to activate our tap.

316
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,808
Well, if you have a problem with that, your
office can contact our general counsel.

317
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,504
That's all I can say.

318
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:28,243
How about this? How about
the State's Attorney for Baltimore City...

319
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:31,516
calls a press conference
on the courthouse steps to declare that...

320
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,582
Bay Wireless is in league with the most
violent drug traffickers in the city...

321
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:39,221
preventing their apprehension and arrest
by law enforcement.

322
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:46,103
Four to five days turnaround.
Best we can do.

323
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,875
I swear, I felt like a damn balloon
with air rushing out my ass...

324
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,638
going from desk to desk.

325
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,312
This is our new man, huh?

326
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,851
- Frank Reid.
- Dennis Wise.

327
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,019
Reverend, our man Dennis spent all day...

328
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,054
down at the Benton Building,
trying for permits.

329
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,054
- On the new gym?
- Yeah.

330
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:07,922
You use my name?

331
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,719
You use anybody's name?

332
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,328
Hell, man. There was a time I'd have used
Smith and Wesson.

333
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:19,497
No, look, man, I'm just saying, how y'all
regular folk get it done in this town?

334
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,334
Doreen, ring Delegate Watkins, please.

335
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,858
- Yellow tops, yellow tops.
- Obliged, man, obliged.

336
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,336
Keeping it close, you know?
You tell a friend, okay?

337
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,737
Too hot for them black tees, right?

338
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:01,304
- What's up, papa, what you hawking?
- Body bags.

339
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,844
All right, let me get 30. Thirty pills.

340
00:23:04,983 --> 00:23:07,850
Thirty? Where the fuck your raggedy-ass...

341
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,818
come up with $300
in motherfucking cash, man?

342
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:11,786
Well, I've been selling these
T-shirts for weeks now, you know.

343
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,688
I mean, I might be raggedy,
but I'm in a cash business.

344
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,158
You want my money or no?

345
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,032
Yeah, we out. All right.

346
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,934
Shouldn't be long.

347
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:34,368
A bulk purchase justify a discount, right?

348
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,507
- $250 or so?
- $275.

349
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,347
- And a couple of them whiteys.
- Yeah, that'll work.

350
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,780
<i>- That'll work.</i>
- Bubs just made another $25.

351
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:48,056
- Theresa D'Agostino, please.
<i>- I'm sorry, but she's not in.</i>

352
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,425
<i>- Can I take a message?</i>
- No, I'll call back.

353
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,495
- So, how's that working?
- What?

354
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,803
- Your new ho.
- So far, so good.

355
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,447
- You got the receipts, man?
- Yeah, most of them.

356
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,992
A few blew out the damn window
on the interstate.

357
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,284
What, y'all waiting to see Avon?

358
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,263
Man, I hear y'all shot the crown off
an old lady's head yesterday.

359
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:34,972
Good, y'all made it.

360
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:40,008
Yeah, we putting in some work.
Come on upstairs so we can talk.

361
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:50,415
Back with numbers.

362
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,047
- How many?
- Twenty-four Trac phones.

363
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:57,589
Two each from Mondo Marts in Catonsville
and Sykesville and four from Frederick...

364
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,961
and then eight each from two stops
over the river in West Virginia.

365
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,291
Those bumper beepers?
They work great, man.

366
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:10,202
- He went out l-70 this time.
- Can you blame him? The scenery's better.

367
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,236
Twenty-four, huh?

368
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,437
We're gonna have a lot of DNRs up.
But with any luck...

369
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:19,676
one of these phones leads
to young Mr. Bodie Broadus.

370
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:21,677
- You wanna call Pearlman?
- All right.

371
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,213
Who's hungry?

372
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,223
- How about Chinese?
- Sounds good to me.

373
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:29,657
- You guys call it in and I'll go.
- Let me have some of that lo mein.

374
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,524
You take a turn typing this shit
and I'll go with him.

375
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:34,857
- Make mine sweet and sour.
- Lo mein for me.

376
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,525
Get rolling?

377
00:25:40,036 --> 00:25:43,335
So y'all get with Charles,
he gonna give you all the details on it.

378
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:48,739
- Who that?
- East Side niggas.

379
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:53,145
Be willing to soldier up for us on retainer.
Milton put me up on them.

380
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:57,945
Man, we gonna be back where we was,
String. You know, I can smell it.

381
00:25:58,054 --> 00:26:01,751
We just got to get this boy Marlo
and then we spread out like we do.

382
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:06,221
Them co-op boys, man, they ain't
too happy about this situation, man.

383
00:26:06,329 --> 00:26:10,060
Yeah. They say they got cops on corners
where they wouldn't have otherwise.

384
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:12,430
- Everybody nervous.
- Man, fuck them niggas.

385
00:26:12,535 --> 00:26:15,026
I mean, Prop Joe said he'd mediate.
You know what I mean?

386
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:16,468
Go to Marlo, talk on it.

387
00:26:16,572 --> 00:26:18,767
Yeah, well, if he take a gun with him,
maybe it could work.

388
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,342
Let me ask you something, though.

389
00:26:20,443 --> 00:26:23,879
Did you tell them discount-ass niggas
that they could pop off at Omar grandma?

390
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:26,810
Oh, man. Sham come to me
in the middle of the meeting...

391
00:26:26,916 --> 00:26:29,407
and talk about they got their sights on
Omar.

392
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:32,885
They say nothing about no grandma.
No church hat, nothing like that.

393
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:35,082
I hear the cocksucker's name, I say, "go."

394
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,619
- On a Sunday morning?
- Yo, I don't give a fuck, man.

395
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:40,525
I hear that cocksucker's name, man,
I ain't thinking about a church day.

396
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:43,326
The Sunday truce been around
long as the game itself, man.

397
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,832
I mean, you know what I'm saying,
you can do some shit...

398
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:49,894
and be like "what the fuck,"
but, hey, just never on no Sunday, man.

399
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,201
I mean, it's just like people
was talking on us and all...

400
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:54,833
and the stories are
getting bigger and bigger.

401
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:58,209
Like, I swear to God, Fatface Rick heard
that our people went and shot...

402
00:26:58,314 --> 00:27:00,874
Omar granny in the ass
on purpose, and all that.

403
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:03,850
And that pulled their dicks out,
pissed on her crown and shit.

404
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:07,319
No, I mean, I heard the same bullshit.

405
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:10,221
Prop Joe gave me an earful.
But, yo, what can I say, man?

406
00:27:10,326 --> 00:27:11,623
Good help is hard to find.

407
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:14,628
If it wasn't, you think I'd be paying
East Side niggas for shit?

408
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:18,327
Yeah. Yo, we still off them corners?

409
00:27:19,535 --> 00:27:20,797
Yeah, got to be.

410
00:27:21,704 --> 00:27:24,070
We gonna be off them corners
till we take care of Marlo.

411
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:26,835
Yeah, maybe we should
put a couple more crews...

412
00:27:26,943 --> 00:27:29,070
on them free zones them cops got.

413
00:27:29,412 --> 00:27:31,539
You know what I mean?
Take the profit where we can.

414
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:35,139
- You trust that shit?
- I mean, so far.

415
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:37,185
And if they running game, man,
they ain't gonna get...

416
00:27:37,286 --> 00:27:40,380
nobody higher than a crew chief
to take a charge, right?

417
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:45,250
What you gonna do with them two niggas
you got waiting downstairs?

418
00:27:45,995 --> 00:27:48,395
I gonna make them buy the lady a new hat.

419
00:27:50,132 --> 00:27:53,260
What're we waiting for? Sweet and sour?

420
00:27:57,573 --> 00:27:59,063
You do the cookie first?

421
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:02,103
What's the difference?

422
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:10,612
"A new friend makes himself known."

423
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:14,815
Himself?

424
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:19,686
If it was "herself,"
then you'd have a fortune.

425
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:25,056
Shit, I'm married with lawn furniture, man.

426
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:31,003
The technology's out of control,
no question.

427
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:32,472
But that's nothing new.

428
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:35,135
The way these guys are using disposables
nowadays...

429
00:28:35,244 --> 00:28:37,940
we cannot get a working wire up in time.

430
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:40,515
By the time we get subscriber
information and papers served...

431
00:28:40,616 --> 00:28:41,583
They're dumping phones.

432
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:44,983
Cellular carriers tell them they need
nearly a week to process the paperwork.

433
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:48,523
They're only half-scared of us,
but a visit from the Feds?

434
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:52,025
- You all have profile enough to push them.
- I don't know.

435
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:55,962
If you've got them down to five days,
you're doing about as well as we can.

436
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:59,895
Once again, guys, the Bureau's
a little busy with counter-terrorism.

437
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:01,367
And our US Attorney here...

438
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,098
he only touches himself
at the mention of political corruption.

439
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:08,802
Ghetto drug stuff just doesn't rate.
I'm sorry to say.

440
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:14,972
Shit always smells best in the car,
going home.

441
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:20,451
<i>Unit 13. In the alley in the rear,</i>
<i>East Side, 800 North Montford.</i>

442
00:29:20,556 --> 00:29:23,525
- That's five blocks, up and over.
- Go.

443
00:29:57,526 --> 00:29:59,619
<i>What's the cross street?</i>
<i>What's the cross street?</i>

444
00:30:03,432 --> 00:30:07,732
<i>Shots fired.</i>
<i>Sounded like it was west of Milton.</i>

445
00:30:31,994 --> 00:30:35,862
I'm police! He's 10-7, call it in.

446
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,530
A Glock.

447
00:31:00,256 --> 00:31:02,019
I saw the gun as he turned.

448
00:31:02,291 --> 00:31:05,419
It's Derrick. Jesus Christ.

449
00:31:05,961 --> 00:31:09,192
You killed Derrick. It's Waggoner.

450
00:31:09,598 --> 00:31:11,691
You fucking killed Waggoner!

451
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:23,304
- Greggs.
<i>- Prez shot another cop.</i>

452
00:31:23,946 --> 00:31:25,004
What?

453
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:27,582
<i>It was an accident in an alley,</i>
<i>a little while ago.</i>

454
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:29,207
- No.
<i>- I'll call you back.</i>

455
00:31:38,894 --> 00:31:41,761
- You here for Barksdale?
- I'm here for peace, man.

456
00:31:41,864 --> 00:31:45,027
- There's some senseless shit going on.
- But Barksdale ain't sent you?

457
00:31:45,134 --> 00:31:46,965
No, Stringer knows I'm here, man.

458
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:51,163
If I can bring something respectful back,
they most likely to show the same.

459
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,540
Tell the boy he can come in with the co-op.

460
00:31:54,677 --> 00:31:56,611
If he takes our package, which by the way...

461
00:31:56,712 --> 00:31:59,203
is better than the best
he putting out there now...

462
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:02,109
he'll keep his corners. Guaranteed.

463
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:05,414
He might listen. But the boy got ideas.

464
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:07,813
And he's thinking Avon weak right now.

465
00:32:08,424 --> 00:32:11,882
You ever know Avon Barksdale
to back down from anything?

466
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:29,333
A plainclothesman in a dark alley,
with his gun out and shots fired.

467
00:32:29,445 --> 00:32:31,413
Look, no one wants to burn anybody...

468
00:32:31,513 --> 00:32:34,573
but the fact is
there's a racial component to consider.

469
00:32:34,683 --> 00:32:36,810
- The appearance of it...
- Has he seen a lawyer?

470
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:48,586
- Lieutenant.
- What?

471
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:50,999
He's in a situation where
you can't compel a statement...

472
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,126
out of him until you read him his rights,
and we haven't done that yet, so...

473
00:32:54,236 --> 00:32:57,535
I'm his commanding officer.
I just want to know if he's all right.

474
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,098
Okay, okay, there's <i>just...</i>

475
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:04,272
It's a legal question at this point.

476
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:20,327
Can I get you anything?

477
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:30,401
You should call the union, Roland.

478
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,470
Talk to a lawyer
before you say anything further.

479
00:33:36,645 --> 00:33:39,876
I'm not saying anyone's gonna
charge anything criminally.

480
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:43,117
Everyone knows you had no intention <i>of...</i>

481
00:33:45,454 --> 00:33:47,115
But administratively...

482
00:33:47,656 --> 00:33:50,386
you need to be careful
because of the racial thing.

483
00:33:50,492 --> 00:33:51,823
You see that, right?

484
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:56,495
There's gonna be people in the Department
who see this that way.

485
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:04,832
- You see that, right?
- I wasn't scared, I wasn't angry.

486
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,410
I didn't give a shit he was black
or <i>whatever...</i>

487
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,121
Or maybe I did.

488
00:34:22,057 --> 00:34:25,356
How the fuck do you know
if that's in your head or if it's not?

489
00:34:26,562 --> 00:34:30,054
- But you saw the gun.
- Yeah.

490
00:34:30,833 --> 00:34:34,929
Yeah, he turned toward me <i>and...</i>

491
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:39,963
'Cause you shouted, right?
You shouted, "police" and he turned, right?

492
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,508
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I said anything.

493
00:34:48,016 --> 00:34:49,608
I don't think he did.

494
00:34:49,752 --> 00:34:54,280
I was a couple steps in the alley
and he turned and I saw the gun.

495
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,414
That's all.

496
00:34:58,327 --> 00:35:03,026
- Did he have kids? A wife?
- I don't know.

497
00:35:03,399 --> 00:35:06,300
They won't say.
They won't talk to me about him.

498
00:35:06,402 --> 00:35:09,530
Call the FOP. Get a lawyer, Roland.

499
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:12,565
No, sir.

500
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:15,634
I'm done.

501
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:27,746
Let the lawyer talk for you.

502
00:35:35,564 --> 00:35:36,622
Lieutenant...

503
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,838
tell Lester I'm sorry.

504
00:35:58,353 --> 00:36:02,016
Call the union.
He wants a lawyer in there with him.

505
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,625
Whenever he's done here,
you need to send someone home with him.

506
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:14,224
For tonight at least, he's a suicide watch.

507
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:20,404
Lieutenant. You'll back him?

508
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:27,513
What I mean is, if this thing should turn...

509
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:31,575
into some kind of a black-white thing,
you're his unit commander...

510
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:34,455
he can count on you, right?

511
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:46,529
You all right?

512
00:36:51,406 --> 00:36:52,532
Lo mein.

513
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,051
What a clusterfuck.

514
00:37:04,086 --> 00:37:07,886
- How many years on for Waggoner?
- Six and a half.

515
00:37:08,624 --> 00:37:12,390
Two commendations,
16th on the current sergeants list.

516
00:37:12,594 --> 00:37:15,586
Pretty much the exact opposite
of that goof in there.

517
00:37:16,498 --> 00:37:18,432
You know what's in that guy's jacket?

518
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:23,032
Motherfucker flaked out,
shot up his own radio car.

519
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:26,804
They were gonna charge him
with false report until Valchek weighed in.

520
00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:32,341
You know he married
Valchek's daughter, right?

521
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:37,647
Fucking goof had nine lives
behind that shit.

522
00:38:07,182 --> 00:38:10,549
Eight up, and the rest still to be activated...

523
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:13,212
whenever the cellular company
gets to our subpoenas.

524
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:17,287
You did good, detective.

525
00:38:19,828 --> 00:38:21,193
So we're looking for what?

526
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,691
Looking for one of these phones
to give us a signature on our man Bodie.

527
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:30,938
Calls to his girlfriend, his grandmother.
The numbers we pulled off the burners.

528
00:38:31,607 --> 00:38:33,472
We see that, we know it's his phone.

529
00:38:33,909 --> 00:38:37,709
We know it's his phone,
we know he use it to sell drugs.

530
00:38:38,046 --> 00:38:39,536
We know all that.

531
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:44,576
Then we get a tap up and pray like hell
he doesn't throw it away anytime soon.

532
00:38:47,356 --> 00:38:48,823
Prez would love this.

533
00:38:52,561 --> 00:38:53,858
I ain't gonna lie to you all.

534
00:38:54,229 --> 00:38:56,959
I don't know about nothing
except the boxing part.

535
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,894
That's all I was thinking.

536
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:03,571
- Were you a pug?
- Yeah, I was.

537
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:05,739
But I got sidetracked, though.

538
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:08,935
Well, Reverend Reid seems to think
you'd be quite a draw...

539
00:39:09,044 --> 00:39:11,740
for some of these corner kids that we got.

540
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:15,408
They didn't think so downtown?

541
00:39:17,052 --> 00:39:21,853
Well, the fact is you're looking to put
your gym in the Fourth District.

542
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:25,020
So your councilperson
would be Eunetta Perkins.

543
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:27,561
Do you know Miss Perkins?

544
00:39:27,763 --> 00:39:30,698
Well, few of us do anymore. Few of us do.

545
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:35,593
Well, since we can't really
rely on Miss Perkins...

546
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:37,569
Miss Daniels here will go with you.

547
00:39:37,673 --> 00:39:42,076
She's here because constituent service
is the life of a city councilperson.

548
00:39:42,477 --> 00:39:45,469
- She needs to get a taste of that.
- At least I hope I do.

549
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,311
If you don't mind me asking, Mr. Watkins.
Why are you doing this?

550
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:51,852
Do you know who Reverend Reid is?

551
00:39:51,953 --> 00:39:54,148
Well, the voters in my district do.

552
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,787
This came today?

553
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:03,929
Well, now, see, this is fucked up.

554
00:40:04,032 --> 00:40:07,195
Oh, I give you $250,000
to have them tell me my paperwork...

555
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:10,430
is insufficient enough to certify me
as a developer in the empowerment zone?

556
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:14,908
- Yeah, yeah, you could call it fucked up.
- Look, I know we touched the right people.

557
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:17,205
Just let me get with them,
clear this mess right up.

558
00:40:17,312 --> 00:40:19,780
- Get with them.
- Hey, I'm on it, String.

559
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:23,578
You got the light bulb franchise, right?
That came through. Now...

560
00:40:23,685 --> 00:40:25,084
You talking about $30,000 coming back.

561
00:40:25,187 --> 00:40:27,451
I'm talking about
the $250,000 that you took.

562
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:30,218
Now, you need to call
Mr. Goose, Mr. Faucet...

563
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:33,522
whoever the fuck you gotta call because
I gave you money to run, remember that?

564
00:40:33,628 --> 00:40:37,223
It ain't like no drug deal, String.
Hell, man, you don't put your money...

565
00:40:37,332 --> 00:40:40,096
on the street and have it come right back.
It don't work like that.

566
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:42,966
- Oh, it don't, huh?
- Patience, my man.

567
00:40:43,705 --> 00:40:45,570
Sometimes with the bureaucracy...

568
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:47,938
the one hand don't know
what the other is all about.

569
00:40:48,043 --> 00:40:51,274
Yeah, well, you know what I see?
I see one hand in my pocket...

570
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,973
while the other hand seem
to have grabbed your dick.

571
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:00,950
Fucking Prez.

572
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:05,951
I don't even feel like working.

573
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,726
- Sanny, baby.
- Welcome to the Western, guys.

574
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:14,095
That thing with Pryzbylewski?

575
00:41:14,669 --> 00:41:18,799
Jesus Christ. So fucking sad, man.

576
00:41:19,207 --> 00:41:21,732
- So you humping a wagon, huh?
- Fuck, yes.

577
00:41:22,277 --> 00:41:25,974
- How's that working out for you?
- Jimmy, I love this fucking gig.

578
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:30,146
The best thing Rawls ever did for me
was to knock me back to a district.

579
00:41:30,352 --> 00:41:33,082
No stress, no struggle.
I work eight-hour shifts.

580
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:36,487
I take nothing home with me.
No, really, I couldn't be happier.

581
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:40,083
All those years knocking my head
against a wall on homicide and for what?

582
00:41:41,396 --> 00:41:43,887
The same fucking pension
with twice the heartburn.

583
00:41:43,999 --> 00:41:45,990
Well, I'm glad you landed
on your feet, Mike.

584
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:54,539
- Hello.
<i>- You called my office?</i>

585
00:41:54,776 --> 00:41:57,267
- Yeah, I did, several times.
<i>- Really, why?</i>

586
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:01,274
- Why do you think?
<i>- A sleepover. You wanna get dinner first?</i>

587
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:04,784
- How about tonight?
<i>- Georgia Brown's down near 15th Street.</i>

588
00:42:04,886 --> 00:42:07,377
That'll work.
You want me to make a reservation?

589
00:42:07,489 --> 00:42:09,923
<i>- No, I can always get a table there.</i>
- All right, whatever.

590
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:13,791
<i>- Let's shoot for 7.:30.</i>
- I'll see you then.

591
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:15,055
<i>- Bye.</i>
- Bye.

592
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:18,693
You in?

593
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:23,195
- What do you think?
- Nice colors.

594
00:42:24,272 --> 00:42:26,297
- You got a platform?
- Schools.

595
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:30,502
- Thought I'd be the education mayor.
- Well, good luck, Tony.

596
00:42:31,413 --> 00:42:33,472
- I mean it.
- Thanks, man.

597
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:37,210
- When do you announce?
- Next month, I think.

598
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:39,851
You know, get out there early,
start raising money.

599
00:42:40,422 --> 00:42:42,515
In fact, I thought I'd make the rounds
of some people...

600
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:44,649
before then, you know? Feel them out.

601
00:42:44,759 --> 00:42:46,886
- What, Watkins?
- Hey, he seems to like me.

602
00:42:46,995 --> 00:42:50,123
What, you really think Odell Watkins
is gonna split from the Mayor's camp?

603
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:54,996
What you could do is, you know,
feel him out on an issue or two.

604
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,539
You go in that way, it's more subtle.
You know, you gotta charm the guy first.

605
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,870
Talk to him about the issues
and then down the road...

606
00:43:00,976 --> 00:43:03,035
see if he's willing to throw
sunshine on your ass.

607
00:43:03,144 --> 00:43:07,012
- I like that. We should do that.
- We?

608
00:43:07,649 --> 00:43:11,915
I was thinking maybe you would ticket
your white ass up with me.

609
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,545
Make a run for council president.
Me at the top of the ticket...

610
00:43:14,656 --> 00:43:17,386
an emerging black leader,
handsome, well-spoken.

611
00:43:17,492 --> 00:43:21,588
You, the great white hope,
the new voice of civic reform.

612
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:23,920
We could give Royce a run, man.

613
00:43:24,032 --> 00:43:26,933
And what makes you think
I'm interested in council president?

614
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:31,971
What the hell else you got going?
Think about it.

615
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:50,754
Look at them.
Like roaches when you turn the lights on.

616
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:53,919
- What's it look like?
- Head and torso.

617
00:43:54,029 --> 00:43:57,760
- You got two casings over here.
- Hold the call.

618
00:43:57,866 --> 00:44:01,199
So much for the
no-violence-in-Hampsterdam theory, huh?

619
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,128
Herc...

620
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:10,242
- help them move the body.
- What?

621
00:44:10,345 --> 00:44:12,108
Just up the block, just out of the free zone.

622
00:44:12,213 --> 00:44:13,612
Carv, you lost your fucking mind?

623
00:44:13,715 --> 00:44:15,808
Before the ambo gets here
to pronounce him, we can do it.

624
00:44:15,917 --> 00:44:18,147
- Why?
- Because if homicide gets here...

625
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,512
if they do any kind of canvass...

626
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:21,987
they're gonna get wind of this shit
on the sixth floor downtown.

627
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:24,558
- Good.
- Herc, come on.

628
00:44:24,726 --> 00:44:27,217
No way, man. No way.

629
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:34,191
Fuck those stripes. Fuck them.

630
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:39,173
Hey, Toke, Gil, help me move this guy
out of Hamsterdam.

631
00:44:42,344 --> 00:44:45,541
I'll be first officer at the scene.
It's my responsibility.

632
00:44:50,552 --> 00:44:52,213
Don't forget the casings.

633
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:01,894
Make sure that you call me.

634
00:45:01,997 --> 00:45:03,055
- I will. Thank you.
- Let me know, okay?

635
00:45:03,231 --> 00:45:04,357
- Take care.
- All right.

636
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:08,936
Yes!

637
00:45:31,993 --> 00:45:33,620
7-60 to KGA.

638
00:45:33,728 --> 00:45:35,559
<i>Go ahead, 7-60.</i>

639
00:45:35,864 --> 00:45:38,924
Have 700, 10-11 me on Vincent Street,
below Fayette.

640
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:41,093
10-4, Vincent south of Fayette.

641
00:45:42,737 --> 00:45:44,637
Hey. You say you worked with this guy?

642
00:45:46,508 --> 00:45:50,171
Three shots, no warnings.
He scared of black people or something?

643
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:51,312
Shit.

644
00:45:54,983 --> 00:45:57,816
- The shit's gone too far, man.
- Hey, you're telling me.

645
00:46:05,226 --> 00:46:08,525
Yeah, I need the number
to the newspaper, <i>The Sun.</i>

646
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:14,326
Yeah, the number for the reporters.
The newsroom, yeah.

647
00:46:23,211 --> 00:46:26,339
- So, you ain't gonna say nothing on it?
- What is there to say?

648
00:46:27,449 --> 00:46:30,646
- Avon, this is blood. Family.
- I know it.

649
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:33,448
And I'm telling you that someone
may have done this to us, Avon.

650
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:36,318
- To our family.
- The cop's just saying that shit.

651
00:46:36,424 --> 00:46:38,153
- To mess with your head.
- Exactly.

652
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:39,226
Why?

653
00:46:39,494 --> 00:46:41,587
That cop don't know me for shit.
What the hell am I to him?

654
00:46:41,696 --> 00:46:43,561
He know you're gonna
wanna think this thing...

655
00:46:43,665 --> 00:46:45,997
that D, you know,
he wouldn't do what he did.

656
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:47,295
I do think it!

657
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:57,237
Was it some beef he had?
Someone on the inside?

658
00:46:57,345 --> 00:46:59,836
That cop said it was someone
who didn't want you to know...

659
00:46:59,948 --> 00:47:01,813
and so they made it look like it did.

660
00:47:02,183 --> 00:47:03,377
Nobody did nothing.

661
00:47:03,485 --> 00:47:05,453
- But the cop said...
- He's lying.

662
00:47:07,522 --> 00:47:08,682
He paid to lie.

663
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:27,632
Avon, you are my brother.

664
00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:32,272
I need to know this more than anything.

665
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,013
D did not roll on us.

666
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:41,752
He came to the edge,
but he turned around and walked away.

667
00:47:42,090 --> 00:47:45,958
And I know he was willing to do
what he had to for his family.

668
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:47,094
For us.

669
00:47:49,764 --> 00:47:51,789
But I need to know that you know that.

670
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:54,559
That you saw him that way.

671
00:47:54,669 --> 00:47:58,730
What? What you trying to say?

672
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:05,206
- Lf something happened...
- The fuck are you even thinking?

673
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,177
That I had something to do with it?
I could do that to my own kin?

674
00:48:10,985 --> 00:48:14,716
Is that what you fucking think?
The fuck is in your head?

675
00:48:16,991 --> 00:48:20,825
I ain't do nothing to D.
I ain't had shit to do with it.

676
00:48:23,298 --> 00:48:24,560
To do with what?

677
00:48:27,702 --> 00:48:30,830
- To do with what?
- Whatever happened.

678
00:48:33,808 --> 00:48:36,140
Whatever it is that happened, Brianna.

679
00:48:56,397 --> 00:48:58,661
You think I don't know my business?
Is that what you think?

680
00:48:58,766 --> 00:49:01,360
Look I understand. I can see
the body was moved from the block.

681
00:49:03,471 --> 00:49:06,531
I can get him to you tomorrow morning.
Just let me see if I can find him.

682
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:07,869
Look, I'll make good on this.

683
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:08,943
Take care of this.

684
00:49:10,111 --> 00:49:11,135
What'd he say?

685
00:49:11,246 --> 00:49:13,612
They found a blood trail
going back up the block.

686
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:17,783
- So maybe...
- Smeared, with drag marks.

687
00:49:20,388 --> 00:49:22,413
And they also found
a third casing at the other end.

688
00:49:22,523 --> 00:49:23,785
Shit.

689
00:49:26,728 --> 00:49:28,025
So what's the deal?

690
00:49:28,129 --> 00:49:30,654
The deal is, we turn this into a dunker
by tomorrow morning...

691
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:33,256
or he starts typing a report for ISD
and the Deputy Ops.

692
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:35,732
- Fuck me.
- No, fuck me!

693
00:49:43,278 --> 00:49:45,013
Look, you didn't move that body, Sergeant.

694
00:49:45,013 --> 00:49:45,308
Look, you didn't move that body, Sergeant.

695
00:49:46,481 --> 00:49:49,814
I moved the body. You understand?

696
00:49:50,752 --> 00:49:53,016
Look, I respect that you did
what you did on behalf...

697
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:57,217
of what I'm trying to do down here,
but the responsibility is mine.

698
00:50:00,428 --> 00:50:02,123
Well, so what do we do?

699
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:07,829
He basically said he wasn't gonna commit
any new resources...

700
00:50:07,935 --> 00:50:10,301
though he has placed it on the agenda...

701
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:13,897
of the Coordinating Council
on Criminal Justice, for what that's worth.

702
00:50:14,008 --> 00:50:16,442
Poor Clarence. He's looking tired.

703
00:50:17,078 --> 00:50:19,308
So we're looking for help
from the State House.

704
00:50:19,614 --> 00:50:22,105
If the city could get
a couple hundred thousand...

705
00:50:22,216 --> 00:50:24,776
we could afford an overtime detail
to protect these folks.

706
00:50:24,886 --> 00:50:27,377
I know this is an easier sell
with the Mayor involved, but...

707
00:50:27,488 --> 00:50:29,479
- Could you convince him?
- Clarence?

708
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:32,991
- He barely listens anymore.
- Jesus, tell me about it.

709
00:50:33,094 --> 00:50:34,721
I mean, I been a councilman
for three years now...

710
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:36,888
that's a long fucking time to be ignored.

711
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:44,135
I'm saying the rules got broke.
My people kept their promises...

712
00:50:44,405 --> 00:50:47,897
they did what they said
and they were as good as their word.

713
00:50:48,676 --> 00:50:53,045
Y'all, y'all ain't keep up your end of it.

714
00:50:53,147 --> 00:50:54,239
Wasn't my people.

715
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:56,749
Look, I ain't making
those distinctions right now.

716
00:50:56,851 --> 00:51:00,150
The fact is, somebody brought a gun
up in the free zone and used it.

717
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:02,347
And both those things
against the promises made.

718
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:05,620
Now, I can't justify this shit
if I got dead bodies up in there.

719
00:51:06,361 --> 00:51:09,728
So, what I'm saying is this,
come tomorrow...

720
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:12,356
if I don't have a shooter in bracelets...

721
00:51:12,467 --> 00:51:16,904
this whole Hamsterdam affair is over,
it's finished.

722
00:51:17,004 --> 00:51:18,835
I'm gonna take my people
back up on the corners...

723
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,908
and we gonna fuck y'all every way we can.

724
00:51:21,008 --> 00:51:25,001
You hear me?
Yeah, it was good while it lasted, huh?

725
00:51:25,313 --> 00:51:28,510
You had cash on the barrel
and you ain't never need no bail money.

726
00:51:28,616 --> 00:51:30,584
And hell, I had clean corners
everywhere I looked.

727
00:51:30,685 --> 00:51:35,019
But all that gonna be gone tomorrow,
unless y'all bring me my shooter.

728
00:51:43,097 --> 00:51:44,792
You think that'll work?

729
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:47,868
Do you?

730
00:51:52,073 --> 00:51:53,665
That's good food.

731
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:00,012
- How'd you know about this place?
- It was big when Clinton was in.

732
00:52:00,114 --> 00:52:03,845
This and the Red Sage.
Now it's all steakhouses and cigar bars.

733
00:52:05,653 --> 00:52:09,180
So you live here, but you spend
a lot of time in Baltimore, right?

734
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,985
I have work up there.

735
00:52:11,392 --> 00:52:14,020
And the alumni stuff
with St. Mary's on the Hill.

736
00:52:14,128 --> 00:52:16,892
I went to UM Law,
so I still have connections there, too.

737
00:52:16,998 --> 00:52:19,865
- Actually, I grew up in Homeland.
- Yeah?

738
00:52:21,669 --> 00:52:23,296
Lauraville for me.

739
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:28,605
- Where'd you go to college?
- Loyola. Only one year.

740
00:52:29,243 --> 00:52:31,871
My girlfriend got pregnant, <i>so...</i>

741
00:52:33,848 --> 00:52:37,215
- So?
- <i>So...</i>

742
00:52:38,953 --> 00:52:41,421
So you became a cop in Baltimore.

743
00:52:41,689 --> 00:52:43,919
- How's that working for you?
- It's pretty good.

744
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:47,788
You know.
I do a lot of high-end drug stuff. Wiretaps.

745
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:51,693
Prolonged investigations
of violent offenders, that kind of stuff.

746
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,159
Fact is, there's not a lot
of guys in the department...

747
00:52:55,269 --> 00:52:57,703
who can do that kind of thing.
You know, it takes a <i>certain...</i>

748
00:52:59,307 --> 00:53:01,639
I don't know, you gotta love it.

749
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:07,844
Thrill of the chase and all that.

750
00:53:14,489 --> 00:53:18,619
- So, you do what in politics?
- I do political campaigns.

751
00:53:19,794 --> 00:53:24,561
- You mean like a campaign manager?
- More of a strategist really.

752
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:26,599
Not so much the day-to-day stuff...

753
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:29,499
but the strategy
of how a candidate can win.

754
00:53:30,238 --> 00:53:32,638
A consultant of sorts.

755
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,676
- You strategizing for anyone in Baltimore?
- I shouldn't say.

756
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,879
I mean, he hasn't
officially announced anything yet.

757
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:41,979
He any good?

758
00:53:43,684 --> 00:53:46,244
Hey, if you're for him,
I'll throw the guy a vote. What the hell.

759
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:47,821
Who'd you vote for this time?

760
00:53:48,756 --> 00:53:51,520
What?
You mean Bush and what's-his-name?

761
00:53:51,826 --> 00:53:52,850
Kerry.

762
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:55,151
You didn't vote for president?

763
00:53:55,263 --> 00:53:57,458
I thought about it, yeah, and, you know...

764
00:53:58,232 --> 00:54:00,598
Bush seemed way over his head, I know...

765
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:02,999
but he wasn't gonna win
in Maryland, anyhow.

766
00:54:04,138 --> 00:54:07,767
Besides, these guys,
it doesn't matter who you got.

767
00:54:08,676 --> 00:54:10,473
None of them has a clue
what's really going on.

768
00:54:10,578 --> 00:54:12,739
I mean, where I'm working every day...

769
00:54:12,847 --> 00:54:15,839
the only way any of these guys
is even gonna find West Baltimore is if...

770
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,646
I dunno, Air Force One
crash-lands into Monroe Street...

771
00:54:18,753 --> 00:54:20,186
on its way back to Andrews.

772
00:54:21,556 --> 00:54:23,046
It just never connects.

773
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:26,851
Not to what I see, anyway.

774
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,231
Hey, that's just me, though.

775
00:54:36,871 --> 00:54:39,840
The man Colvin say
he want the boy locked up...

776
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:42,273
or the free zone shuts down tomorrow.

777
00:54:42,376 --> 00:54:44,071
All she wrote for Hamsterdam.

778
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,706
- Colvin?
- From the Western.

779
00:54:48,749 --> 00:54:52,549
- Sham, who is this kid, man?
- Some young boy from Tuckie's crew.

780
00:54:52,653 --> 00:54:54,644
He connected? Kin to anybody?

781
00:54:54,755 --> 00:54:56,916
No, he only been on
for a couple months or so.

782
00:54:57,525 --> 00:54:58,685
What he use the whistle for?

783
00:54:58,793 --> 00:55:02,889
Some nigga in one of Ghost Kane crews
laughed at his shoes.

784
00:55:08,169 --> 00:55:09,227
Do it.

785
00:55:20,448 --> 00:55:22,109
I'll be out in a minute.

786
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:29,690
No, he needs to put those
in the departmental mail.

787
00:55:31,025 --> 00:55:32,049
Yeah.

788
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,693
What do you need?

789
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:39,896
- To turn myself in.
- For what?

790
00:55:41,836 --> 00:55:45,932
- I shot a boy.
- Oh, yeah?
