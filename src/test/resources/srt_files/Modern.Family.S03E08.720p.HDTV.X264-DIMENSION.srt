1
00:00:02,681 --> 00:00:04,742
Oh, thank you so much
for the donations.

2
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:07,134
I wish I could do more, it's just
a bunch of out of date clothes.

3
00:00:07,135 --> 00:00:08,629
Oh, I'm sure it's great.

4
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:12,261
Three weeks ago,
our neighbours the Rands

5
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,633
lost their house and everything
they owned in a fire.

6
00:00:15,955 --> 00:00:17,462
Fortunately, nobody was hurt.

7
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:20,075
And fortunately, they're friends
with wonder woman over here.

8
00:00:20,076 --> 00:00:21,459
I'm hardly wonder woman.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,638
She mobilized the community
to donate clothes,

10
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:26,141
furniture, appliances,

11
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:27,859
all to help them start over
in their new rental.

12
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,985
- Which you found them.
- I'm no Wonder Woman.

13
00:00:30,002 --> 00:00:31,688
Rand-aid was her idea.

14
00:00:31,888 --> 00:00:34,016
It wasn't my idea to
call it "Rand-aid."

15
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:36,098
Okay, fine.

16
00:00:36,863 --> 00:00:38,097
I'm Wonder Woman.

17
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:39,782
Terrible tragedy.

18
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:41,208
They're our closest friends.

19
00:00:41,209 --> 00:00:42,193
We know them.

20
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:43,849
Uh, Manny and their
son Reuben are tight.

21
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,309
In fact, I put in one
of their closets.

22
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,560
Not that it matters,

23
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,530
but it was the only structure
to survive the fire.

24
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:50,431
Por favor,
don't even say that word!

25
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,347
In my country it is considered
very, very bad luck

26
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:54,879
when your house burns down.

27
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:58,907
They lived a block away from us.

28
00:00:58,908 --> 00:01:00,005
Smoke was everywhere.

29
00:01:00,006 --> 00:01:02,717
I was so upset,
I couldn't sleep for days.

30
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:05,048
Of course, Mitchell
won't let me take anything.

31
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:06,949
Well, Cam, we both know why.

32
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:09,591
Some people have been
known to sleepwalk

33
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:11,744
or even sleep drive
on that medication.

34
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,179
Cam's reaction is much worse.

35
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:25,692
Oh! Ohh!
Oh, God.

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,493
I sleep clown.

37
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:32,901
Dad, you're gonna kill yourself.

38
00:01:32,902 --> 00:01:34,625
- I got it!
- We're on a schedule here.

39
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:36,127
I still have to pick up the truck.

40
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:38,048
If you want him
to stop lifting things,

41
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,428
put all this in grocery bags

42
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:41,270
and turn the TV on
to a football game.

43
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:44,383
Oh! Take this phone
away from me!

44
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,263
Why?

45
00:01:45,264 --> 00:01:47,552
Two of our best brokers left
to start their own agency,

46
00:01:47,553 --> 00:01:49,343
and the office gossip is flying.

47
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:51,056
But I want today to be
about the Rands...

48
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:53,087
And if I have this--
Oh, my God!

49
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:54,566
Those guys took two secretaries

50
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,775
and the tube dude with them!

51
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:57,204
Who's the tube dude?

52
00:01:57,205 --> 00:01:58,911
You know, the blowy guy
that attracts all the attention.

53
00:01:58,912 --> 00:02:00,021
This guy...

54
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,183
Ah, si, I've seen him.

55
00:02:02,184 --> 00:02:05,041
He goes down over there,
and then he shakes up.

56
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,330
- And goes down in there, and then...
- You almost got it.

57
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:08,292
And then goes down.

58
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:10,960
Hi, hi, sorry. We would
have been here sooner,

59
00:02:10,961 --> 00:02:12,830
but this one had
a wardrobe crisis.

60
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:14,167
You know,
it's a somber occasion,

61
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,776
and all my tops are too joyful.

62
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,729
- You do not want our problems.
- No.

63
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,186
- Oh, here, Jay, let me help.
- No, I got it.

64
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:21,033
- Aah! My back!
- Dad!

65
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,021
No, Jay, that's not quite it.

66
00:02:23,022 --> 00:02:24,451
Remember, you got air
blowing through you,

67
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:25,578
so it's more like...

68
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:27,776
And then out.
And then out.

69
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:40,309

70
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:43,942
Leave me alone. I'm fine.
I've gotta pick up that truck.

71
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:45,610
I'd be happy to get the truck.

72
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:47,984
I don't think so.
It's a pretty big truck.

73
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:50,372
Oh. Is it--is it bigger
than the combine

74
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:52,165
I've been driving since
I was 12 years old?

75
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:54,173
Or the Windrow tractor
with the Macdon header

76
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,645
that I drove to
and parallel parked

77
00:02:55,646 --> 00:02:57,790
at my High School prom? Hmm?

78
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,232
At least something
got plowed that night.

79
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:01,394
Heard that!

80
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,826
Oh, son of bitch!

81
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,757
Your low back is in spasm, Jay.

82
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:06,062
I can massage that out for you.

83
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:08,018
I'm fine. Dad, you don't
know what you're missing.

84
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:09,604
Phil is a magician.

85
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:10,940
And a licensed masseur.

86
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,310
Before I heard the siren song
of residential real estate,

87
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:15,326
I was bitten by the rub bug.

88
00:03:15,327 --> 00:03:17,703
No, he's--he's amazing.
I had this knot in my leg,

89
00:03:17,704 --> 00:03:19,302
two minutes with Phil
and it was gone.

90
00:03:19,303 --> 00:03:21,663
I'm sorry, but I think you might
have a higher tolerance

91
00:03:21,664 --> 00:03:23,581
for a man's hands
on your body than I do.

92
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,248
- Charming.
- Ay, don't be an idiot.

93
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:27,533
Let Phil help you.

94
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:28,476
Fine.

95
00:03:28,477 --> 00:03:30,557
Great! I'll just go
get the room ready.

96
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:32,973
I'll think you'll be surprised
with what these hands can do.

97
00:03:33,025 --> 00:03:34,787
Really? Can they drive
a bobcat skid-steer

98
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:37,110
with a bucket grapple through
a school hallway on a dare?

99
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:39,653
Because these can and have.

100
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:43,682
Poor Reuben, huh?

101
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:46,146
Having to rebuild
his whole life at age 12.

102
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:48,133
Yeah. That blows.

103
00:03:48,134 --> 00:03:50,814
I know we're both shaken up,
but let's watch the language.

104
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:54,053
Okay, put this in a safe place.
It's for Reuben.

105
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:55,551
It's one of those, um,

106
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,338
how do you say again,
the takka-takka-takka...

107
00:03:57,339 --> 00:03:59,333
Is that the helicopter
with the camera in it...

108
00:03:59,334 --> 00:04:00,714
- Mm-hmm.
- That you control with your phone?

109
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:02,107
The one I asked for?

110
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:04,074
Okay, when your house burns down,

111
00:04:04,075 --> 00:04:05,499
you get one of these.

112
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,446
Now don't burn your house down.

113
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,328
How lucky is Reuben?

114
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:12,531
So lucky.

115
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,498
You know what?
I say we take this thing out

116
00:04:14,499 --> 00:04:17,598
- and see how she flies.
- I don't know. My mom got it for Reuben.

117
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:20,166
Oh, so now he won't
even share his toys?

118
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,103
He never does.

119
00:04:21,104 --> 00:04:22,363
Screw that guy!

120
00:04:22,364 --> 00:04:23,525
Yeah!

121
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:25,658
You're a terrible influence.

122
00:04:25,659 --> 00:04:26,931
You need me.

123
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:31,468
Claire, in case you want
to add something,

124
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:33,919
I put the box of dresses outside

125
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,078
and this is the box
of snicker snackers.

126
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:37,815
Mm. Thanks.

127
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:42,326
Mitchell, we did have something
to add to this box of, um...

128
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:43,816
Snicker snackers.

129
00:04:44,353 --> 00:04:45,369
What?

130
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,819
English is not her first language.

131
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,078
She's just trying to help.

132
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,218
Mitchell, come on.
You can't do that.

133
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:52,184
You can't just change the rules.

134
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:53,245
This is what we do.

135
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:54,655
When Gloria says something silly,

136
00:04:54,656 --> 00:04:56,791
we innocently laugh
behind her back.

137
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,323
She's had a rough week,
all right?

138
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,137
She's really worried
about tia Maria Cecilia

139
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:01,102
and that surgery.

140
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:03,497
Oh, and then she lost
her cell phone at pilates.

141
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,248
- How do you know this?
- We have coffee.

142
00:05:05,446 --> 00:05:06,419
Oh. Have?

143
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,627
So when did this become,
like, a thing?

144
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:11,501
What's the big deal?
We're friends. I like Gloria.

145
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,021
Uh, it's no big deal.

146
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:16,286
I have nothing against her,
I just think-- Oh!

147
00:05:19,926 --> 00:05:20,669
Mm. All right.

148
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,483
So before you get all judge-y,
I gave her that vase.

149
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:25,429
After I gave it to you.

150
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,716
You couldn't part
with that T-shirt?

151
00:05:31,859 --> 00:05:33,263
I love this shirt.

152
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,563
You know, you don't have
to look the way you look.

153
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,774
Amber rand lost
all her clothes in a fire,

154
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:40,101
but she gets to build
herself a new wardrobe.

155
00:05:41,004 --> 00:05:42,194
Let me burn your clothes.

156
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,323
Girls, get down here.
There's a lot of work to do.

157
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:47,553
- Ugh. She's in a mood.
- You know what we have to do, right?

158
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,714
- There's no way you're my real sister!
- I hate you! I can't believe you would ever--

159
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:50,840
- you're the most selfish--
- Okay,

160
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,111
That's it! I cannot take the fighting!

161
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:54,803
Just get out of the house.

162
00:05:55,711 --> 00:05:57,378
Works every time.

163
00:05:58,172 --> 00:05:59,751
You know, I don't even
wanna drive the truck anymore

164
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:01,231
even though on the farm I was--

165
00:06:01,376 --> 00:06:03,103
I can't take another farm story.

166
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:05,183
Yay! You might wanna
take someone with you.

167
00:06:05,184 --> 00:06:06,828
The thing's been parked
there six months.

168
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,406
You're gonna want to hose it down,
sweep for spiders.

169
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,402
Good news, girls.
You're going with Uncle Cam.

170
00:06:12,864 --> 00:06:14,051
Yay!

171
00:06:15,105 --> 00:06:16,477
The pain must have
been pretty bad

172
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,099
if I was asking Phil for help.

173
00:06:18,523 --> 00:06:21,084
His need for my approval
is exhausting.

174
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,584
In ten years, I've asked him
for one thing--

175
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,712
to hook up my wireless printer.

176
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,213
He still won't shut up about it.

177
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,590
How's that printer
working out for you?

178
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:34,674
Still loving that printer, eh?

179
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,148
You know, if your printer
breaks from here,

180
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:38,013
I can fix it on my phone.
Can you?

181
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,808
I can, but I don't need to,

182
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:41,508
because I fixed it forever.

183
00:06:42,073 --> 00:06:43,538
Just once,
I wish he wouldn't make

184
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:45,487
such a big deal about everything.

185
00:06:47,967 --> 00:06:49,093
Okay.

186
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:53,317
Now just disrobe and place
the towel over your buttocks.

187
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:02,857
Riding the open road

188
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:04,032
in a big rig like this

189
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:07,251
sure can work up a man's
powerful appetite.

190
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,761
We've gone five blocks.

191
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,918
- Do you want a burger or not?
- I could eat.

192
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,120
Hey, Alex,

193
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,518
maybe Uncle Cam will let you
borrow his hat later.

194
00:07:14,544 --> 00:07:16,131
You know, since
you dress like a dude.

195
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:17,832
I like the way I dress.

196
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,189
Uncle Cam, as her
future prom date,

197
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,563
will you please talk to her?
You know fashion.

198
00:07:22,564 --> 00:07:24,757
First of all, you're each
beautiful in your own way,

199
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:25,837
but you're both
playing for second,

200
00:07:25,838 --> 00:07:27,839
because I'm too sexy for...
this truck.

201
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,571
I have to say, you do
drive it surprisingly well.

202
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:31,904
Yeah, who would have thought?

203
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:33,914
Surprising?

204
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:36,635
What, that--that a gay man
can drive a truck?

205
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:39,911
You know, I expect that kind
of thinking from Jay's generation.

206
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:42,231
But from our future generation?

207
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:43,156
No.

208
00:07:43,157 --> 00:07:45,647
Wow. This place got crowded.

209
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:48,380
Whoa. You're really
wedged in there.

210
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:49,811
You want us to help
guide you out?

211
00:07:50,974 --> 00:07:52,091
That question--

212
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:54,349
it was like a hate crime.

213
00:08:00,286 --> 00:08:01,366
Sorry!

214
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,292
Hey, you're really
close on this side.

215
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:04,717
Yeah, I see it.

216
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,555
- Careful!
- I'm being careful.

217
00:08:10,287 --> 00:08:11,541
Gasping? Really?

218
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,661
Holding hands?
We're not in a nosedive.

219
00:08:19,484 --> 00:08:20,177
Okay, you know what,

220
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:21,886
if it would make you feel better,
get out and guide me.

221
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:23,366
Okay, come on. Let's go.

222
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:26,436
Please don't yell at me,
but there's not enough room.

223
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:27,889
Okay, climb over.

224
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:34,245
You're fine.

225
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,770
You know, the native Americans
believe that burning sage

226
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,674
kept bad energy away.

227
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,545
How'd that work out for 'em?

228
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:48,305
Get to the back.

229
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,292
That's the spirit.

230
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,452
Thank you.

231
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:54,904
I just need to make sure
that the oil is a perfect 98.6.

232
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:02,288
And it is perfect.

233
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:06,074
Now I want you
to take a deep breath

234
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:09,463
and let me transport you to a land

235
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:12,110
I call relaxistan.

236
00:09:12,354 --> 00:09:14,613
Oh, what the hell?
Get off me.

237
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,262
I knew this was a terrible...

238
00:09:18,115 --> 00:09:20,308
Oh, mama Lucian, that's good.

239
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,019
So you wanna try it?

240
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,350
I don't know.
I'm still feeling guilty.

241
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,827
It's Reuben's helicopter.

242
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,914
Reuben is the whole reason
we should be doing this.

243
00:09:35,928 --> 00:09:39,575
He's barely living proof that
life can change in a second.

244
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:42,590
You gotta grab what
you can when you can.

245
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:44,852
What is this hold
you have on me?

246
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:47,706
Wow.

247
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:48,895
Okay, now ease up.

248
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:51,141
Okay, I'm easing up.
Okay, it's not working.

249
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:53,886
- Get ahold of yourself, Manny!
She's getting away! - I can't--I...

250
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,567
- I can't hold her!
- Give it to me!

251
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:56,949
Mayday! Mayday!

252
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,241
Oh, well.

253
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,253
What do you mean "oh, well"?
My mom's gonna kill us.

254
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,098
Us? You were flying it.

255
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:06,859
I was in the attic packing boxes.

256
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,008
You're gonna help me find it,

257
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:09,723
or the next search
will be for you.

258
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,811
I like this guy.
Where's he been?

259
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:16,584
Just relax.

260
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:18,623
Let me know if I'm hurting you.

261
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:20,959
Are you kidding me?
It's fantastic.

262
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,409
I love you.

263
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:27,030
This! I love this!

264
00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:28,614
It just slipped out.

265
00:10:28,615 --> 00:10:30,478
Those are the worst three words
I could say to Phil.

266
00:10:30,479 --> 00:10:32,057
I was just praying
he would let it go

267
00:10:32,058 --> 00:10:33,755
and not make a big deal about it.

268
00:10:33,756 --> 00:10:35,735
Oh, my God.

269
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,678
This is huge.

270
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,344
Jay, I'm sorry.

271
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:40,906
I need a minute.

272
00:10:42,444 --> 00:10:43,892
Son of a bitch!

273
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:48,868
Son of a bitch.

274
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:51,910
Oh, these are fantastic.
Why is Manny getting rid of them?

275
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:53,528
He said that they
were last season.

276
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:54,861
I used to have a pair like these.

277
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,184
I can never find 'em anymore.

278
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:57,994
Oh, there's an outlet store.

279
00:10:58,097 --> 00:10:59,247
They don't have men's size,

280
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,924
but I'm sure the biggest
size for boys

281
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:03,257
would fit you perfectly.
I'll take you.

282
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:06,268
- All right. It's a date.
- Oh. Another date.

283
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:08,799
Claire, I heard what
happened with the vase,

284
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,574
but I don't want you
to worry about it.

285
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:14,198
I'm so sorry. I should have
told you about that sooner.

286
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:18,200
It just--I have really been
shaken by this whole fire thing.

287
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:20,876
You know, life is so fragile.

288
00:11:20,877 --> 00:11:23,281
I know, like a vase.

289
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,743
You tattled on me?

290
00:11:28,744 --> 00:11:31,351
She asked me about it.
What was I supposed to do?

291
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:37,399
Why are you making those
cruel sounds with your mouth?

292
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,932
You don't see it?

293
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,627
You're turning Gloria into mom.

294
00:11:41,702 --> 00:11:42,685
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:11:42,686 --> 00:11:44,343
First you got
all defensive of her,

296
00:11:44,344 --> 00:11:46,024
and then you tattled on me to her.

297
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:47,580
That's exactly what
you did with old mom.

298
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,647
It's what you're doing
with new mom.

299
00:11:48,648 --> 00:11:49,779
- Okay, okay.
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,381
Only you could make
my friendship with Gloria

301
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:52,302
into something ugly.

302
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:54,123
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's sweet.

303
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:56,628
We've all got our thing.
You have mommy issues.

304
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:58,577
I do not have mommy issues!

305
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,315
Okay. So I pick you up tomorrow,

306
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:03,046
we go get you
your big boy pants,

307
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,267
and then we go and get
a little ice cream, okay?

308
00:12:06,986 --> 00:12:08,292
Perfect. Yeah.

309
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:12,733
Hi.

310
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:15,256
You still don't feel very good?

311
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:16,794
I told Phil I loved him.

312
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:18,030
Oh. It was an accident.

313
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:20,366
- You know how he gets with that stuff.
- Ay, I know.

314
00:12:20,367 --> 00:12:23,252
Jay, can I talk to you later
about what just happened?

315
00:12:23,253 --> 00:12:24,383
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

316
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,376
Jeez, I just worked that out.

317
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:29,845
You're screwed.

318
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:33,703
Today is the biggest
day of my life.

319
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,109
Just relax.

320
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:38,617
Let me know
if I'm hurting you.

321
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:40,671
Are you kidding me?
It's fantastic.

322
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,130
I love you.

323
00:12:42,857 --> 00:12:45,437
This! I love this!

324
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:47,194
Oh, my God.

325
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:49,236
This is huge.

326
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:52,357
Jay, I'm sorry.
I need a minute.

327
00:12:52,663 --> 00:12:54,778
The two guys who left the firm
asked me to quit my job

328
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,512
and partner with them
at the new agency.

329
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:57,874
Big opportunity,

330
00:12:58,772 --> 00:12:59,982
big risk,

331
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:01,858
and they need an answer
by the end of the day.

332
00:13:02,987 --> 00:13:05,528
I don't always make great
decisions under pressure.

333
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,642
What the hell is that?

334
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:09,687
An alpaca.
I got the last one.

335
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:15,806
Come on!
Move that truck!

336
00:13:15,948 --> 00:13:17,223
I hate you!

337
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:20,726
Okay, so... I flirted
with a table of truckers

338
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:21,815
who have offered to help us.

339
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,543
No! No help!
I've come too far!

340
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:25,530
Have you?

341
00:13:25,644 --> 00:13:27,733
Oh, hey! They don't sell
pizzas at this restaurant!

342
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:29,095
You parked here illegally!

343
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:32,026
Congratulations, sir.
You're destroying America.

344
00:13:32,135 --> 00:13:34,336
- Hey, there are no cars behind us. Go!
- Gun it!

345
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,422
- Oh! Ow!
- All right! All right! Everybody relax!

346
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:42,585
We're fine! We're fine!

347
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,510
We are not fine!
And we're all smooshed!

348
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:47,090
And we're scared!
And we're tilted at a 30-degree angle!

349
00:13:47,091 --> 00:13:49,532
Nerd! And we're dirty
and tired and late!

350
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:51,461
Okay!
Can you please just be quiet!

351
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:53,084
Why couldn't we have
just asked for help?

352
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:54,985
'Cause I'm teaching you girls
a very valuable lesson--

353
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:57,129
that gay men can do anything
straight men can do.

354
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,440
Yeah, we know that.

355
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:00,342
Do you think you're the
only gay guy that we know?

356
00:14:00,343 --> 00:14:03,179
Yeah. My soccer coach is gay...
our pediatrician...

357
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,596
- My Latin tutor.
- Nerd! Our electrician.

358
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:06,819
Well, then why
were you so surprised

359
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,869
when I said I could drive a truck?

360
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,544
Not because you're gay,
because you're you.

361
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:11,288
And by the way, you can't.

362
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,045
Okay, wow.
I guess I owe you an apology.

363
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:14,430
I made a leap there.

364
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:15,739
I'm just used to dealing
with stereotypes.

365
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,463
I'm a little sensitive about it.

366
00:14:17,876 --> 00:14:19,148
Oh! There's the trucker
that I talked to.

367
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,883
Hey! Excuse me! Hi!

368
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,622
Could you give us a hand, please?

369
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:23,902
Sure thing, sweetie.

370
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:26,412
Oh, like she'll be able to help us.

371
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,103
Boy, do you have the right idea.

372
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:35,354
Could use a little break from
the mother and child reunion

373
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:36,624
going on down there.

374
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:38,600
Don't ask.

375
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:44,456
Mitchell's turning Gloria into mom.
Bam! It's out. Hmm.

376
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,941
You remember the way mom
and Mitchell used to be

377
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:50,263
in their private little club,

378
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,103
just the two of them, and
no one else allowed in.

379
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,670
Well... it's happening again,

380
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,589
but this time around, it's
happening with your wife.

381
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:03,779
You should see them down there.

382
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,563
It would actually be adorable
if it weren't so sick.

383
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:10,043
I just--

384
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:12,860
you know, I feel like
Mitchell is a grown man,

385
00:15:13,321 --> 00:15:14,619
he has a child,

386
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:17,269
and he's still working
out some psychodrama

387
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,982
from 20 years ago.

388
00:15:20,314 --> 00:15:22,706
Daddy, can I have a sip
of your beer, please?

389
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:27,693
Oh, my God.

390
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,663
Oh, my God.

391
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,062
Mitchell cozies up to mom,
I go running to daddy.

392
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,894
I'm the one who's turning
Gloria into mom,

393
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,486
which is really disturbing
since we're the same age.

394
00:15:40,403 --> 00:15:41,472
You're older.

395
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,359
Oh. Oh, that's where
we're gonna chime in?

396
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:46,906
Will you hurry up?

397
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:48,655
I'm saving my strength

398
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,015
because if we don't
find this helicopter,

399
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,265
I'm walking to Canada.

400
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,285
Hope you like taxes.

401
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:55,972
Hey!
That's our helicopter!

402
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,080
Is it, now?

403
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,219
I'm sure you have the proper
documentation for that.

404
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,151
Just give it back.
It's ours.

405
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,215
You guys are bullies.

406
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:04,140
They can't be bullies.
They're nerds.

407
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:06,170
Don't pigeonhole us.
We can be both.

408
00:16:10,153 --> 00:16:11,303
Is there an issue here?

409
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:14,021
Uncle Cam, I got this.

410
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:19,660
Oh, my God, it's Alex Dunphy.

411
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:20,745
So awesome.

412
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,232
Problem here, boys?

413
00:16:22,324 --> 00:16:24,309
These geeks won't give
us back our helicopter

414
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:25,997
that we took from Reuben.

415
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:27,444
Is that right, Abraham?

416
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:28,916
Oh, my God.
She knows your name.

417
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,430
Helicopter, please.

418
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,736
I love you.

419
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:39,583
What just happened?

420
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:42,418
You have your fans, I have mine.

421
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:46,167
Some day, your fans are
going to work for my fans.

422
00:16:50,371 --> 00:16:51,659
Oh, um, Gloria,

423
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,705
do you mind if I talk to
Mitchell alone for a minute?

424
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:56,155
It's okay.
I already know what you said,

425
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:57,310
and I think it's crazy.

426
00:16:57,311 --> 00:16:59,214
Mitchell is not making
me his mommy.

427
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:02,508
No, I know. He's not, but
I think that I might be.

428
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:05,082
Okay, now you're going
really, really crazy,

429
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,157
because I am younger than you.

430
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,635
Mm, by 14 months,
so let's settle down.

431
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:12,135
What is going on with you today?

432
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:15,298
I... all right, I'm
working this out as I go.

433
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,241
I think maybe seeing you
get all buddy-buddy today

434
00:17:20,242 --> 00:17:23,636
with Gloria made me feel like it did

435
00:17:23,637 --> 00:17:25,861
when you were with mom, and--and...

436
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:29,076
I don't know.
I-I felt like the odd man out.

437
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:31,648
Okay. Well, that--that's how I
used to feel with you and dad.

438
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:35,818
I know. I know.
We--we chose teams,

439
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:37,579
even during the divorce. It...

440
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,174
Okay, the last couple years,

441
00:17:42,415 --> 00:17:44,236
you and I have been our own team.

442
00:17:44,422 --> 00:17:47,062
You know?
And I don't want that to go away.

443
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:49,191
So...

444
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:51,756
I guess I just felt a
little left out today.

445
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:52,921
Shut up.

446
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,360
Okay, can you two try hugging a box

447
00:17:57,361 --> 00:18:00,449
so that your poor mother doesn't
have to do all the hard work?

448
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:03,161
I am sorry, Gloria, about
all the mom stuff today.

449
00:18:03,162 --> 00:18:05,450
I just--I got this crazy idea

450
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,419
that you liked Mitchell better than me.

451
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,452
I do like Mitchell better than you.

452
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:10,664
What?

453
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:11,874
Ay, please.

454
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,561
Are you going to honestly tell me

455
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:15,629
that I'm your favorite
person in this family?

456
00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:18,484
I'm not even your favorite
Colombian in this family.

457
00:18:18,747 --> 00:18:20,648
I would love to get closer to you.

458
00:18:20,812 --> 00:18:22,307
You have my number.

459
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:25,286
But call me quickly
because I book up.

460
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:28,409
You never saw me.

461
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:33,809
There you are.

462
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,949
I really need to talk to you.
You really don't.

463
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,704
Jay, please.
It's about work.

464
00:18:37,705 --> 00:18:39,400
I got a text during your massage.

465
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:41,719
I've been offered a
partnership in a new agency.

466
00:18:42,072 --> 00:18:43,218
Oh.

467
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:45,750
Good for you!

468
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,078
I'm not so sure.

469
00:18:47,154 --> 00:18:48,460
I mean, there's--there's a big upside,

470
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,369
but I have a stable job right now.

471
00:18:51,371 --> 00:18:53,936
I have three kids, and at least
one of them's going to college.

472
00:18:54,052 --> 00:18:55,830
Worse case scenario, they all go.

473
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,956
Well, what does Claire think?

474
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,855
I haven't told her yet.
I wanted to talk to you first.

475
00:19:02,139 --> 00:19:03,206
You've done this.

476
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:06,488
Well, I think that there's
only really one question.

477
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:09,495
Whether I'm ready to
run my own company?

478
00:19:09,543 --> 00:19:10,772
Ah, you're great with people.

479
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:12,251
We know you're a good salesman.

480
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:14,809
You've managed to provide a
good living in tough times.

481
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:16,770
Then what?
Is this the right time?

482
00:19:16,771 --> 00:19:19,322
Never a perfect time.
House could burn down tomorrow.

483
00:19:19,567 --> 00:19:22,557
Question is, do you want this?

484
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:24,841
Yeah.

485
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:26,710
Yeah, I really want it.

486
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:28,212
Then gamble on yourself.

487
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:31,344
I'd gamble on you.

488
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,266
I'm gonna do it.

489
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:36,324
There you go!

490
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:38,399
Thanks, Jay.

491
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,583
Hey, look, I know you were
reluctant to get that massage,

492
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,000
but I think we can both agree
it had a happy ending.

493
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:46,831
Please don't say that.

494
00:19:46,987 --> 00:19:50,137
If I could only save one
possession in a fire,

495
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:52,544
probably my first set of golf clubs.

496
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:54,413
My old man gave 'em to me.

497
00:19:57,421 --> 00:19:59,148
The engagement ring that Jay gave me

498
00:19:59,149 --> 00:20:00,688
that changed my life.

499
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:03,173
Lily's adoption papers.

500
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:05,058
I was gonna say adoption papers.

501
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:08,793
So I guess, then, I would
say my mom's recipe book.

502
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:11,747
All our family photos...

503
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,031
Which I keep on my iPad,

504
00:20:14,032 --> 00:20:15,425
so my iPad.

505
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:17,592
As long as I have my family,

506
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,193
I wouldn't need anything else.

507
00:20:19,194 --> 00:20:20,331
Aw, man!

508
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:21,409
Come on! What?

509
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,156
You say something like that,
it makes us all seem petty.

510
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,482
Yeah. Well...

511
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,907
I know.

512
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:31,856
Hiss!

513
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:39,576
Shh! Cam's sleeping.
I don't wanna wake him.

514
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:41,992
He's had a rough day.
Not as rough as grandpa's truck.

515
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:46,078
Shh! Thank you so much for driving me.

516
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,905
I really didn't want to
ride in that big rig.

517
00:20:47,906 --> 00:20:50,187
It was amazing.
Everybody was honking,

518
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:53,486
and I learned, like, five new curse words.
Mostly from Cam.

519
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:56,590
Oh, I'm glad I could
give you a laugh today.

520
00:20:56,686 --> 00:20:58,127
You know, I didn't know that's
what I was to you people--

521
00:20:58,128 --> 00:21:00,742
- a big joke.
- No, honey, it wasn't like that.

522
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,176
No, we really didn't mean--
Uncle Cam, we love you.

523
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,386
Save it.

524
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:04,946
I'm going back to bed.

525
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:08,049
So he's still doing that?

526
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,357
Yeah.
Yeah, but we're working on it.

527
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:13,557
