1
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:42,438
This is Russo. Please leave a message.

2
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,982
He's not answering my calls.

3
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:46,233
It's over, and he must know it.

4
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:49,236
You don't think there's
any way he can recover?

5
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:52,949
The Republicans will play that interview
on every radio and television station

6
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,451
from now until November 5th.

7
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:58,913
I sympathize with the kid, but this
was my concern from the beginning.

8
00:01:58,914 --> 00:02:01,206
And I should've listened to you, sir.

9
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,960
I thought he could handle the pressure.

10
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:06,004
Okay. So he withdraws.

11
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:07,588
We need to replace him.

12
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:09,757
You have any ideas?

13
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,136
With less than two months to go?

14
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:15,972
If the President hadn't shut
me out of the early discussions,

15
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:18,099
I could've come up with some good options,

16
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,977
but I don't know anyone who's got
the name recognition and donor base

17
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:25,523
to start a campaign from
scratch just seven weeks out.

18
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:27,733
Let me think.

19
00:02:29,152 --> 00:02:32,113
Everything hinges on
the next few minutes...

20
00:02:32,114 --> 00:02:36,408
all my months of planning,
every move I've made.

21
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:42,040
- There is one person.
- Who?

22
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,877
You, Mr. Vice President.

23
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:50,464
If you ran to reclaim your seat,

24
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:52,008
I think you'd win by a landslide.

25
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,676
Resign the vice presidency.

26
00:02:53,677 --> 00:02:55,761
Only if you win.

27
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:57,930
Walker needs me for 2016.

28
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,518
Are you entirely certain he's
gonna keep you on the ticket?

29
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,188
I mean, it's no secret

30
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:08,607
the two of you don't exactly get along.

31
00:03:08,608 --> 00:03:10,401
What has he said?

32
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:15,948
Oh, you're putting me in a very
awkward position, Mr. Vice President.

33
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:18,534
Has he been bad-mouthing me?

34
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:23,122
Well, the exact phrase he
used was "pain in the ass."

35
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:29,879
That fucker.

36
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,006
He's got no idea how to lead,

37
00:03:32,007 --> 00:03:34,550
no sense of respect.

38
00:03:34,551 --> 00:03:36,719
- Oh, is this his idea?
- No.

39
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,013
- His way of getting rid of me?
- No. It struck me yesterday,

40
00:03:39,014 --> 00:03:40,765
and I just thought it was worth suggesting.

41
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,558
But, no, I haven't
discussed this with anyone.

42
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,393
And you shouldn't.

43
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:48,022
People don't leave the White
House to become a governor.

44
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:52,902
May I ask you a personal question, sir?

45
00:03:52,903 --> 00:03:55,487
Do you want to be the Vice President?

46
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:59,242
Peter said that when you were
out on that campaign trail,

47
00:03:59,243 --> 00:04:02,078
you had so much enthusiasm and energy

48
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,415
that he thought you maybe
missed being the Governor.

49
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:10,377
I do miss it.

50
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:12,713
Then why not go back?

51
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:14,924
You could be the hero of this election

52
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:19,053
and secure Pennsylvania
for the Democrats in 2016.

53
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:23,057
Garrett would never go along
with something like this,

54
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:25,059
even if he hates my guts.

55
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,936
It would make him look weak,

56
00:04:26,937 --> 00:04:30,064
like he's lost control
of the administration.

57
00:04:30,065 --> 00:04:32,316
Not if it was a mutual decision.

58
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:35,486
Look, let me talk to Garrett.

59
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:37,905
I won't mention that we've spoken.

60
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:43,035
I suppose there's no harm in
finding out what he thinks.

61
00:04:43,036 --> 00:04:45,621
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

62
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:53,587
- Slogans for 400.
- "1976. He's making us proud again."

63
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,506
- D.J.
- Who is Carter.

64
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,842
- No. John.
- Who is Ford.

65
00:04:57,843 --> 00:05:00,678
- Peter?
- Slogans for 600.

66
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:05,099
- "1888. Grandfather's hat fits Ben."
- Peter, are you here?

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,143
- Claudia.
- Who is Benjamin Harrison.

68
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:10,104
- Yes.
- Presidential slogans for 800.

69
00:05:10,105 --> 00:05:12,940
- "1900... "
- On the train ride down,

70
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:14,900
I almost called the police
to have them break in

71
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:17,611
and make sure you hadn't hurt yourself.

72
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:21,406
I'm not gonna even ask you what
happened. It doesn't matter right now.

73
00:05:21,407 --> 00:05:24,618
- "1964. In your heart, you know he's right."
- What matters right now...

74
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:26,954
- what matters...
- Who is Goldwater.

75
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:30,124
- Claudia
- Who is Goldwater.

76
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:31,709
Barry Goldwater. Yes.

77
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:37,965
Oh, come on. Hey, I'm watching that.

78
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:44,471
What matters is the 50 reporters
in front of your building

79
00:05:44,472 --> 00:05:47,975
and the 150 campaign staffers who
don't know if they still have a job.

80
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:50,144
It's over.

81
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:54,023
I know.

82
00:05:54,024 --> 00:05:56,525
So, tell them to go away.

83
00:06:09,747 --> 00:06:13,000
What, are you just gonna hole yourself
up in here and hope it all goes away?

84
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:14,668
Yeah, that's pretty much the plan.

85
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,171
Well, I won't let you.

86
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:20,716
Hey, put that down. Hey.

87
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:23,386
- Hey, put that down!
- Peter...

88
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:41,653
We need to put out a statement.

89
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:43,906
Call me when you're prepared to do that.

90
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:49,078
I'll be at the headquarters in Philly.

91
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:55,709
I was scared that I was starting to feel

92
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,588
too much for you.

93
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,507
I think that's why I ended it.

94
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:04,427
And you have no room for fear?

95
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:07,388
No. Being afraid doesn't
accomplish anything.

96
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,723
That's not true. When I'm overseas,

97
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:12,435
rational fear... disease or violence...

98
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:15,229
that sort of fear keeps you alive.

99
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,107
Back here, God,

100
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:19,984
I find myself afraid of things

101
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:23,570
that I can't name or point to.

102
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:27,366
It's like, uh, how little am I seeing?

103
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:30,995
Or have I wasted this day or this moment?

104
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:33,080
Yeah, I think that sometimes...

105
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:35,874
whether my life will add up.

106
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:40,129
Francis would roll his eyes

107
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,798
if he heard me talking like this.

108
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,470
Does he know where you are?

109
00:07:48,846 --> 00:07:50,931
No, he doesn't.

110
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:03,694
If he's looking for you,
that's where you are.

111
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:06,405
Over there.

112
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:08,449
Before you met Frank.

113
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,493
Alone.

114
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:12,453
Curious.

115
00:08:12,454 --> 00:08:14,913
Absorbing everything.

116
00:08:14,914 --> 00:08:18,292
You have no idea what I
was like when I was a girl.

117
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:22,671
Did he ever know that side of you?

118
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:28,177
He wasn't interested in that girl.

119
00:08:28,178 --> 00:08:30,095
And neither was I.

120
00:08:30,096 --> 00:08:32,139
What were you interested in?

121
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,350
Being more than an observer.

122
00:08:34,351 --> 00:08:36,394
You wanted to be seen.

123
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:38,854
Not just seen.

124
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:41,857
I wanted to be significant.

125
00:08:49,115 --> 00:08:51,158
There's no historical precedent.

126
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,494
Aaron Burr ran for Governor,
Calhoun for the Senate.

127
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:57,373
200 years ago. One shot a man in a
duel, the other believed in slavery.

128
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:59,624
Is that really the sort of
company we wanna share, Frank?

129
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:03,128
Mr. President, we stand losing
control of an important swing state,

130
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:06,382
our majority in the house, and quite
possibly your second term in office.

131
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:09,718
Preventing all of that may
require unconventional measures.

132
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,512
It would look like I'm pushing him out.

133
00:09:11,513 --> 00:09:14,598
Or worse... that he's
abandoning the administration.

134
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,809
You make a joint statement.

135
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,145
You say he won't resign unless he wins.

136
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:23,690
If he loses, he stays on as Vice President.

137
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:26,860
No one could accuse either of
you of disloyalty to the other.

138
00:09:26,861 --> 00:09:29,613
- Did Jim come to you with this?
- No. It's entirely my idea.

139
00:09:29,614 --> 00:09:32,824
I wouldn't dream of speaking to the Vice
President without passing it by you first.

140
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:34,701
I think he'd take it as an affront,

141
00:09:34,702 --> 00:09:37,037
like I'm trying to get rid of him.

142
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:40,374
Honestly, sir, I think he might be
more interested than you imagine.

143
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,168
- Why is that?
- Well, I hesitate to bring this up,

144
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:46,589
but when he was campaigning for Russo,

145
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,426
he spoke quite freely about you, sir.

146
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:56,056
Mm-hmm. Tell me.

147
00:09:56,057 --> 00:09:58,392
Of course, I'm getting
this secondhand from Peter,

148
00:09:58,393 --> 00:10:00,311
but the gist of it is that...

149
00:10:00,312 --> 00:10:02,896
that you lack entirely in leadership,

150
00:10:02,897 --> 00:10:05,983
and that you have no sense of respect.

151
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:08,026
And he wants more responsibility.

152
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,028
And how do I give him that when he shows

153
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,948
absolutely no discretion, no discipline?

154
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:14,908
Well, that is entirely my point. Now, look,

155
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,910
I take full responsibility
for backing Russo,

156
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:19,580
but there could be a
silver lining in all this.

157
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:21,457
You could accomplish two goals:

158
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:23,708
Secure Pennsylvania for the Democrats

159
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,421
and find an honorable
way to replace Matthews.

160
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:29,089
What do you think?

161
00:10:30,215 --> 00:10:32,259
I think it is a very big decision,

162
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,219
and we do not want to make it impulsively.

163
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,721
I agree. I'd like to put
some more thought into it.

164
00:10:36,722 --> 00:10:38,890
Well, that is very prudent,
sir. Just bear in mind,

165
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,059
seven weeks out, that every day counts.

166
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,659
- Hi, sir.
- How much is it?

167
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,244
Oh, I got your receipt right here.

168
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:07,419
No, no, no. It was... it was just $40.

169
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,589
Yeah. Don't tell anyone, all right?

170
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:14,468
No. I... I never say
anything about our tenants.

171
00:11:16,053 --> 00:11:17,971
- The press still outside?
- Yeah.

172
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:20,015
I told them you weren't
here, like you said.

173
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:22,725
Most of them left. There's
still, you know, a few, though.

174
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:25,812
If I wanted to leave, is there a
place I could do it without being seen?

175
00:11:25,813 --> 00:11:28,148
Yeah. The freight elevator
down to the garage.

176
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,069
- I could call you a cab or...
- All right. Thanks. I'll let you know.

177
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,071
Mr. Russo, uh...

178
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:35,947
sir, it's none of my business,

179
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:39,618
but, uh, my Uncle... he fell
off the wagon a few times.

180
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:42,329
When he did, the best thing for
him was just not to be alone.

181
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,915
I'll give you this money back,
I'll take that bag off your hands,

182
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:46,709
come in here, keep you company...

183
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,420
I appreciate it. I'll let
you know if I change my mind.

184
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:43,742
Sit down.

185
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:47,912
Where's Claire?

186
00:13:47,913 --> 00:13:50,123
Not here.

187
00:13:50,124 --> 00:13:53,418
So what is this, tying up loose ends?

188
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:56,505
I wouldn't presume.

189
00:13:56,506 --> 00:13:59,550
People like you can't be neatly tied up.

190
00:13:59,551 --> 00:14:01,552
But I thought perhaps we could start...

191
00:14:32,332 --> 00:14:34,793
It's very tasteful.

192
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:16,042
This is the dress she wore to the gala.

193
00:15:16,043 --> 00:15:17,878
I believe so.

194
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,755
It is.

195
00:15:19,756 --> 00:15:21,799
I recognize it.

196
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,014
Go back into the bedroom.

197
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:53,956
I'm amazed how well you got her in focus.

198
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:03,214
What should we call her?

199
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:06,176
Why does she need a name?

200
00:16:06,177 --> 00:16:09,137
I never photograph anyone
without knowing their name.

201
00:16:09,138 --> 00:16:12,015
You didn't take the photograph. I did.

202
00:16:13,475 --> 00:16:16,812
I think we should call her Claire.

203
00:16:18,146 --> 00:16:21,525
She doesn't even look like me.

204
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:23,902
Not even a younger version.
Why do you keep saying that?

205
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:26,697
Not her features, her expression.

206
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:29,700
Hey, we should mount it. You
can hang her in your house.

207
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:31,994
Would Francis object?

208
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:37,582
Can we please not discuss Francis?

209
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,417
You brought him up in the park.

210
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:41,545
I know I did, and I shouldn't have.

211
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,381
So we have to pretend he doesn't exist?

212
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:56,434
I thought we could talk about anything.

213
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:59,980
He is a presence here. You must admit that.

214
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:02,440
When you walked through the door yesterday,

215
00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:05,027
he walked right in with you.

216
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,446
It's just me, nobody else.

217
00:17:08,447 --> 00:17:12,242
You keep telling yourself
that, it might come true.

218
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:20,542
How do you think she'd feel
if she knew I was wearing this?

219
00:17:20,543 --> 00:17:22,920
I don't know.

220
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:27,298
You don't think she'd be upset?

221
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:31,094
She'd probably say you
look very beautiful in it.

222
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:35,139
It's like steel.

223
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,185
You should put it back.

224
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:45,067
I think I'll keep it.

225
00:17:45,068 --> 00:17:48,528
I'll buy you one of
your own, if you'd like.

226
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:51,155
No. I want this one.

227
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:53,867
She came into my bedroom.

228
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:56,453
She should know I came into hers.

229
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:04,168
Is your bed always so perfectly made?

230
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:06,630
It's a habit I formed at military school.

231
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:11,051
What side of the bed does she sleep on?

232
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:14,471
That side.

233
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:35,700
She can keep it.

234
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,703
Fits her better anyway.

235
00:19:23,498 --> 00:19:25,583
Listen, Zoe...

236
00:19:26,543 --> 00:19:29,129
Whatever just happened upstairs,

237
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,131
whatever these past six months have been,

238
00:19:31,132 --> 00:19:34,885
can we agree that it is time to simplify?

239
00:19:34,886 --> 00:19:36,845
What does simple look like?

240
00:19:36,846 --> 00:19:40,724
We maintain our professional arrangement,

241
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:44,102
as you suggested, which I will honor.

242
00:19:44,103 --> 00:19:46,188
You still trust me?

243
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:50,608
What choice do I have?

244
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:53,361
You didn't hurt me

245
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:56,031
or discard me like you said you would.

246
00:20:00,994 --> 00:20:03,914
I'm glad I didn't have to.

247
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:09,544
Yes, we'll agree to simplify.

248
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:12,255
Good.

249
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:36,404
Sorry I'm a few minutes late, Frank.

250
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:43,578
Please, have a seat.

251
00:20:46,998 --> 00:20:49,500
I have a pretty good idea why
you asked for this meeting.

252
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:53,004
- Have you and the President had a chance to speak?
- We have.

253
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:56,091
- Is he leaning one way or another?
- He's torn.

254
00:20:57,801 --> 00:21:00,178
- And what about you?
- I'm a little less torn.

255
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,346
My instincts tell me it's a mistake.

256
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:04,682
You wanna convince me otherwise?

257
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:08,061
Well, look, if your instincts tell you this
is not the way to go, I'm not about to...

258
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:10,897
Frank, I'm gonna ask you
two very direct questions,

259
00:21:10,898 --> 00:21:13,024
and I would appreciate direct answers.

260
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,485
When you got my son into college,

261
00:21:15,486 --> 00:21:17,654
were you anticipating a moment like this?

262
00:21:18,989 --> 00:21:21,074
I don't follow.

263
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,161
Honestly, Frank?

264
00:21:24,162 --> 00:21:26,704
Was I antici...

265
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:30,000
I would be happy to answer you
directly if I knew what you were asking.

266
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:33,628
All right. I will ask
you my second question.

267
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:38,216
Do you want the Vice
Presidency for yourself?

268
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:41,803
I would serve at the pleasure
of the President. That was his...

269
00:21:41,804 --> 00:21:45,098
you proposed this idea so that
you can take Matthews' place.

270
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:47,350
- I did not say that.
- But it is what you want.

271
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:50,561
- What I want is in the...
- The President makes you v.P.,

272
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:52,730
he keeps you on the ticket in 2016,

273
00:21:52,731 --> 00:21:54,983
and you use that as a
springboard to run in 2020.

274
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:58,361
Tell me that trajectory
has never entered your mind.

275
00:21:58,362 --> 00:22:01,114
Well, Linda, I make a habit

276
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:04,159
of considering all trajectories
in any given situation.

277
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,662
But that's a practical
exercise, not a personal one.

278
00:22:07,663 --> 00:22:09,539
So you refuse to admit it.

279
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,708
Admit it's what I want? That's irrelevant.

280
00:22:11,709 --> 00:22:13,710
You're the one who asked
for this meeting, not me.

281
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:15,920
This meeting's about
trying to solve a problem,

282
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:18,089
not fulfill some personal ambition.

283
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:22,969
But if both could be
achieved, you wouldn't object.

284
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,555
I think this is a sound course of action

285
00:22:25,556 --> 00:22:29,017
regardless of who the President
taps to replace Matthews.

286
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:33,230
I must gamble everything I have right now.

287
00:22:33,231 --> 00:22:35,232
If I'm honest, she may use it against me.

288
00:22:35,233 --> 00:22:38,193
If I'm not, she won't lift a finger.

289
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:41,238
I've used the same tactic myself.

290
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,365
Once someone is exposed,

291
00:22:43,366 --> 00:22:45,575
they're at your mercy.

292
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:50,080
She wants to hear me say the words.

293
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:55,417
Yes.

294
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:58,588
I want to be the Vice President.

295
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:03,885
And, yes, I helped your
son get into college

296
00:23:03,886 --> 00:23:06,221
in the hopes that you
would return the favor.

297
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:09,974
But I can't force you to do so, Linda.

298
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:19,234
But I also think that we
would make a formidable team.

299
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:21,569
Look what we've been able to accomplish

300
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,197
even when we've been
at odds with each other.

301
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:28,285
Now put your mind to what we
could accomplish if we weren't.

302
00:23:30,954 --> 00:23:33,623
Thank you for taking the time, Linda.

303
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:43,174
I'll call you back. How'd it go?

304
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:45,427
She's holding her cards
very close to the chest.

305
00:23:45,428 --> 00:23:47,429
- Any word from Peter?
- Nothing.

306
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,471
Christina said he wouldn't
leave the apartment.

307
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:51,557
But I called the doorman, and
he said that Peter was gone.

308
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:53,310
- Where?
- He doesn't know.

309
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:55,812
He needs to officially withdraw
to put pressure on Walker.

310
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:59,065
- I'm trying to track him down.
- Why'd you let him out of your sight in the first place?

311
00:23:59,066 --> 00:24:01,776
I thought he was showering. He disappeared
when I was on the phone with you.

312
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:05,113
There was a plan here, Doug.
He explodes, he withdraws,

313
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:08,325
we put him back together,
and he quietly goes away.

314
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:10,576
Russo has made no public appearances

315
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:12,703
since allegations that he was inebriated

316
00:24:12,704 --> 00:24:16,624
during a radio interview on WZPZ
Pittsburgh yesterday morning.

317
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,419
Sources among the Democratic
leadership have suggested

318
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,173
that the party is currently
considering options to replace Russo.

319
00:24:23,174 --> 00:24:26,050
Meanwhile, Republican
candidate Jack swofford's lead

320
00:24:26,051 --> 00:24:28,386
has jumped to a 24-point margin,

321
00:24:28,387 --> 00:24:30,972
according to an overnight
CNN poll of registered voters.

322
00:24:30,973 --> 00:24:35,352
The swofford campaign is also reporting
a sharp spike in contributions...

323
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:38,229
nearly half a million
dollars in the last 20...

324
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:45,362
I saw that this morning.

325
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:48,448
Francis got Peter to run.

326
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,868
Do you know him well?

327
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:53,995
We weren't close.

328
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:05,756
Do you need to make calls? 'Cause
I can head into the other room.

329
00:25:05,757 --> 00:25:08,218
I don't think so. Thanks.

330
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:29,780
Where are you going?

331
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:32,574
To the lab. I should've gone in today.

332
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:36,454
Adam.

333
00:25:36,455 --> 00:25:38,456
- Adam...
- Just go. Go. Leave.

334
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:40,750
How long do you think this
can possibly go on for?

335
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:42,877
We have never spent more
than 48 hours together.

336
00:25:42,878 --> 00:25:45,255
Maybe there's a reason for that.

337
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:48,758
A part of me still loves you.

338
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,468
Which part?

339
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:57,892
I can't be just a pit stop, Claire,

340
00:25:57,893 --> 00:26:00,728
- or some sort of escape...
- Oh, come on. You're more than that.

341
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:03,481
- ... or a top-up on whatever Francis can't provide.
- Oh, fuck off!

342
00:26:03,482 --> 00:26:05,942
He's my husband, Adam.

343
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:08,736
We've gone through more
than you could ever imagine.

344
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:10,947
I envy your free spirit,
and I'm attracted to it,

345
00:26:10,948 --> 00:26:12,698
but not all of us have that luxury.

346
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:16,286
Which is what I find so
frustrating about you, Claire.

347
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:18,788
You... you had a choice.

348
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,664
You chose not to be free.

349
00:26:20,665 --> 00:26:23,751
No. What I chose was a man I
could love for more than a week.

350
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:31,509
I shouldn't have said that. I...

351
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,429
At least you're being honest.

352
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,475
I can't live moment to
moment like you, Adam.

353
00:26:38,476 --> 00:26:42,437
I have a history with Francis,
I have a future with him,

354
00:26:42,438 --> 00:26:45,231
and it's bigger than a moment.

355
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:48,401
Then you should kill it...

356
00:26:48,402 --> 00:26:51,653
whatever part of you still loves me.

357
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:56,618
If you can't,

358
00:26:56,619 --> 00:26:58,660
I will.

359
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:04,125
- Adam...
- No.

360
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:35,114
- Hello?
- Hey. Hey, sweetie.

361
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:39,369
How's it going? I'm...
are you with your mom?

362
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,288
She's downstairs. You
want me to go get her?

363
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,583
No. No. I just wanted to call

364
00:27:45,584 --> 00:27:48,252
and say, uh,

365
00:27:48,253 --> 00:27:51,381
you know, hey to your...
uh, your brother and you.

366
00:27:51,382 --> 00:27:52,965
Is he... is he there?

367
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:56,219
He's in his room, I think.

368
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,513
Okay. You wanna go get him?

369
00:27:58,514 --> 00:28:00,056
Hold on.

370
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,530
He says he doesn't want to talk to you.

371
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:18,824
Wh... why not?

372
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:21,244
We've seen the news, dad.

373
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:25,289
There were all sorts of TV
cameras at our school yesterday.

374
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,459
Mom's making us stay home this week.

375
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:37,218
I want you to do something.
I want you to go to, uh,

376
00:28:37,219 --> 00:28:40,471
your bedroom window and look out.

377
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:44,350
You see that black car?

378
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:47,144
- Yeah.
- That's me.

379
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:51,190
You shouldn't be here, dad.
Mom would be really angry.

380
00:28:51,191 --> 00:28:54,611
Well, we don't need to tell her.

381
00:28:54,612 --> 00:28:56,195
Right?

382
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:58,948
It'll just be... it'll just be, uh...

383
00:28:58,949 --> 00:29:01,534
it'll just be our little secret.

384
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:03,578
Your voice sounds weird,

385
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:05,996
like it did on the radio.

386
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,710
You... you heard that?

387
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:13,045
I have a computer.

388
00:29:13,046 --> 00:29:15,548
Uh, 

389
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:18,551
I'm sorry.

390
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:20,511
I...

391
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:23,389
Sometimes your dad makes mistakes.

392
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:25,308
- I better go.
- No.

393
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:28,102
I don't like to hear your
voice when it's like this.

394
00:29:28,103 --> 00:29:31,105
It makes me sad. Bye, dad.

395
00:29:31,106 --> 00:29:32,898
Sarah, please...

396
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,093
Peter?

397
00:30:01,094 --> 00:30:02,679
Christina.

398
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,263
Where are you?

399
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:06,223
I'm, uh...

400
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,935
Mm. I'm not...

401
00:30:09,936 --> 00:30:12,062
I'm not... I'm not doing so well.

402
00:30:12,063 --> 00:30:14,190
Where are you, Peter?

403
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:20,571
- I'm in my car.
- Are you driving?

404
00:30:20,572 --> 00:30:21,781
No.

405
00:30:21,782 --> 00:30:24,492
Tell me where you are.

406
00:30:24,493 --> 00:30:26,786
I'm outside my kids' house.

407
00:30:26,787 --> 00:30:29,121
- You mean Madeleine's?
- Yeah.

408
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:31,081
I need you to stay right there.

409
00:30:31,082 --> 00:30:32,958
Okay, Peter?

410
00:30:32,959 --> 00:30:35,169
You'll stay there?

411
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:38,506
Peter.

412
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:41,008
Peter, are you still there?

413
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,968
Hello?

414
00:30:43,886 --> 00:30:45,388
Hello?

415
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,503
I'd like to turn myself in.

416
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,589
For what?

417
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:23,175
A few months ago,

418
00:31:23,176 --> 00:31:26,512
I was pulled over for drunk driving.

419
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:28,681
They let me go. I should've been convicted.

420
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:33,185
Well, if you were let go, sir,
we can't arrest you for it now.

421
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:40,150
Well, I drunk drove
here. Arrest me for that.

422
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:43,654
We can put you in a detox tank...

423
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:46,407
I wanna be formally arrested.

424
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:49,744
My name is congressman Peter Russo.

425
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:55,165
I was arrested in January
on Michigan Avenue.

426
00:31:58,294 --> 00:32:00,546
Please have a seat, Congressman.

427
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:06,969
I gotta make a few phone calls.

428
00:33:08,781 --> 00:33:11,659
- Have you found him?
- I'm in front of his ex-wife's house.

429
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,160
But Christina said he called from there.

430
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:16,121
- He's not there?
- No.

431
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:18,958
But his phone is. I found it by the curb.

432
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:20,459
So we have no way to contact him?

433
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,962
Not unless he reaches out to us.

434
00:33:22,963 --> 00:33:24,421
This isn't good.

435
00:33:24,422 --> 00:33:26,089
Want me to alert the authorities?

436
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,010
Let's give him a little longer.

437
00:33:29,011 --> 00:33:32,137
- How long did it last?
- About six months.

438
00:33:32,138 --> 00:33:35,182
- He was older.
- A lot?

439
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:38,435
Yeah.

440
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:42,272
Was he a journalist, or
did he work on the hill?

441
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:47,236
I'd rather not say.

442
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:49,321
All right.

443
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:55,160
He was someone I looked
up to... for a while.

444
00:33:56,954 --> 00:33:58,998
Why did it end?

445
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,501
He has a wife.

446
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:06,463
We both knew it was gonna end eventually.

447
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,009
I mean, it was really...

448
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:12,887
it was fucked up.

449
00:34:12,888 --> 00:34:14,889
The first night we spent together,

450
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,224
he told me he was gonna
hurt me and then discard me.

451
00:34:17,225 --> 00:34:18,935
And when it ended,

452
00:34:18,936 --> 00:34:21,562
I told him that he'd done neither.

453
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:25,357
But... it does hurt.

454
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,568
I won't hurt you.

455
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:30,279
Yeah, you can't promise me that.

456
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,281
Yes, I can.

457
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:39,455
- Has anyone else seen him?
- No.

458
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:42,875
He's in an interrogation room by himself.

459
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:48,255
I never should've got mixed
up with this fucking mess.

460
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:50,883
We're way behind regret time, Barney.

461
00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:54,971
Just have your guys keep him out of sight.

462
00:34:54,972 --> 00:34:57,180
I'll need a back exit.

463
00:35:22,873 --> 00:35:24,959
- I got him. Thanks.
- Yeah.

464
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,418
Come on.

465
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:40,099
Hey, Peter.

466
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,225
Where's your car?

467
00:35:45,104 --> 00:35:47,106
It's down the street.

468
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:50,651
I'll drive you home. You go back
to mine, have Meechum let you in.

469
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:52,945
- This way?
- Yeah.

470
00:35:57,908 --> 00:36:01,453
What were you thinking, Peter?

471
00:36:01,454 --> 00:36:04,665
I need to take
responsibility for my actions.

472
00:36:04,666 --> 00:36:06,709
By getting yourself thrown in jail?

473
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,712
Real responsibility.

474
00:36:09,713 --> 00:36:12,673
Like... like they talk
about in the meetings,

475
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:14,967
not the lies we told for the campaign.

476
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:17,011
What you just did was extremely reckless.

477
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:19,138
I don't care.

478
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:24,894
I'm making a statement tomorrow, Frank.

479
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:28,856
- About pulling out of the race?
- Mm-mm.

480
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:32,442
That's not enough. I...

481
00:36:33,903 --> 00:36:36,405
I need to stop hiding.

482
00:36:39,992 --> 00:36:42,036
Well, let's work together on the language.

483
00:36:42,037 --> 00:36:44,872
I have to do it on my own.
It's gotta be my own words.

484
00:36:44,873 --> 00:36:47,624
Look, Peter, this isn't just
about you anymore, all right?

485
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:50,794
- Let me help you.
- I don't want your help.

486
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:57,009
I didn't never ask your help
when you... I got arrested.

487
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,053
When did your help ever help me?

488
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:03,432
You can live your life the way you want to.

489
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:06,185
I'm done being told how to live mine.

490
00:37:08,771 --> 00:37:11,774
Well, there has to be a
way to take responsibility

491
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:15,444
without shattering everything.

492
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,242
Are you at least willing
to have that discussion?

493
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,105
- Do you want me to come upstairs?
- No.

494
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:15,921
I know you're in a lot of pain, Peter.

495
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:21,135
But I don't want you to
feel any pain tonight.

496
00:38:21,136 --> 00:38:23,720
Here. You can start fresh tomorrow.

497
00:38:23,721 --> 00:38:27,474
Go ahead. I won't judge you.
Hell, I'll even join you.

498
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:34,356
Just relax.

499
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,901
You're home now.

500
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:46,493
Whatever it is you have to face tomorrow,

501
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:48,954
you don't have to face it now.

502
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:53,542
Right now it's just you and me.

503
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,257
The rest of the world doesn't matter.

504
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:05,512
Your children, Christina...

505
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,639
they will forgive you,

506
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,600
because you're loved, Peter.

507
00:39:11,935 --> 00:39:13,979
Failed.

508
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:19,109
I failed myself.

509
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,611
I failed my family.

510
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:25,615
I failed the campaign.

511
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,995
No, you haven't, Peter.

512
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:34,791
May I?

513
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,726
You know, when Claire
and I were first married,

514
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:55,979
we talked about having children.

515
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,066
I told her flat out I didn't want any.

516
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:02,778
It was selfish but honest.

517
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:05,655
I didn't have a
particularly happy childhood.

518
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:07,866
I suspect you didn't either.

519
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:09,201
No.

520
00:40:09,202 --> 00:40:11,870
You see, no person avoids pain.

521
00:40:11,871 --> 00:40:13,872
And I just didn't think it was right

522
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:16,041
to bring a child in knowing that.

523
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:22,214
But now when I think back, I...

524
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:25,008
I realize that was cowardly.

525
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,805
I see you,

526
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:32,433
and I think, well, there's a brave man,

527
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:34,517
far braver than me.

528
00:40:34,518 --> 00:40:37,396
I'm so tired.

529
00:40:39,148 --> 00:40:43,402
When I... when I think about... when I...

530
00:40:43,403 --> 00:40:46,113
I'm so tired.

531
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:52,369
You should close your eyes.

532
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,874
Let it all go.

533
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:04,589
We have all the time in the world.

534
00:41:09,511 --> 00:41:11,263
Peter?

535
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:21,690
Peter.

536
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,912
I walked back.

537
00:43:56,094 --> 00:43:58,680
Whatever happens in the next few hours,

538
00:43:58,681 --> 00:44:00,932
whatever you hear,

539
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:04,769
we will never speak of it.

540
00:44:39,762 --> 00:44:41,682
Sir...

541
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:46,727
I heard from Linda
about a half an hour ago.

542
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:48,813
The President wants to meet with you.

543
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:50,649
8:30.

544
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:55,111
About what?

545
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:57,531
I don't know.

546
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,501
Frank.

547
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:20,387
Now, when you brought up
this idea, I wasn't sold.

548
00:45:20,388 --> 00:45:24,224
It struck me as both
desperate and careless.

549
00:45:24,225 --> 00:45:28,103
But then Linda laid out all the pros,

550
00:45:28,104 --> 00:45:30,855
and they clearly outweigh the cons.

551
00:45:30,856 --> 00:45:34,901
I explained our reasoning to Jim and hoped
he wouldn't think I was off my rocker.

552
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:39,448
I did at first, but the President
made some very good arguments.

553
00:45:39,449 --> 00:45:41,824
It's a bold move, Frank.
I'm very impressed.

554
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:44,369
Well, thank you, sir, for
being open to the idea.

555
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,996
And thank you, Mr. President,
for taking the risk.

556
00:45:46,997 --> 00:45:48,998
We'll need to work this out step by step.

557
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,543
- The execution has to be perfect.
- Where are things with Russo?

558
00:45:51,544 --> 00:45:53,712
- Any word from him yet?
- We're still trying to locate him.

559
00:45:53,713 --> 00:45:55,922
- Well, is there any cause for worry?
- It's been two days.

560
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:58,216
I am a bit worried, I have to admit.

561
00:45:58,217 --> 00:46:00,427
I mean, this must be an extremely
difficult moment for him.

562
00:46:00,428 --> 00:46:02,220
We're hoping he'll reach out shortly.

563
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,889
Let's get our people on it.
I wanna know where he is.

564
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,975
Now, once he withdraws,
we have to move quickly.

565
00:46:06,976 --> 00:46:09,561
We'll make a joint
statement, as you proposed.

566
00:46:09,562 --> 00:46:11,563
It's a clear message, I think.

567
00:46:11,564 --> 00:46:14,232
Pennsylvanians matter to us, and
we're not gonna let them down.

568
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:17,402
That's right. I'll say that Jim's an
invaluable asset to the White House,

569
00:46:17,403 --> 00:46:19,946
but that I have great
admiration for the sacrifice

570
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:21,948
he's willing to make for
the people of his home state.

571
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:24,534
And you should not accept his
resignation until he's elected.

572
00:46:24,535 --> 00:46:28,079
- That will show your continuing commitment to him.
- I think that's a good idea.

573
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,499
As long as I can devote myself
wholly to the campaign, I agree.

574
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,502
Now, should Jim win, we'll need to
nominate a Vice President immediately.

575
00:46:33,503 --> 00:46:35,545
Linda, you're putting
together a list of names?

576
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:37,589
Yes. And you can begin the vetting process

577
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,174
as soon as you narrow down the choices.

578
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:41,301
I already have a short
list of top contenders.

579
00:46:41,302 --> 00:46:44,102
- I want your input on that, Jim.
- More than happy.

580
00:46:46,222 --> 00:46:48,141
Congressman?

581
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:51,936
Congressman?

582
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:09,746
We can use the existing infrastructure.

583
00:47:09,747 --> 00:47:11,623
Are you okay with Nash Aarons?

584
00:47:11,624 --> 00:47:14,459
I like Nash, but I'll want to
bring in some of my own people.

585
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,628
Well, that won't be a
problem. Nash is a team player.

586
00:47:16,629 --> 00:47:19,880
And we can reallocate some of your
existing 2016 reelection funds...

587
00:47:19,881 --> 00:47:21,966
Excuse me. Linda.

588
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,969
Peter Russo is dead.

589
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:27,888
Suicide.

590
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:31,142
He was found in his garage
with the car still running.

591
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:36,857
I'm so sorry, Frank.

592
00:47:36,858 --> 00:47:40,569
- May I have a moment, sir?
- Of course.

593
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,780
I will get more information
and start drafting a statement.

594
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:46,907
Let's reschedule.
Whenever is best for Frank.

595
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:05,677
Congressman Peter Russo was found dead

596
00:48:05,678 --> 00:48:08,137
early this morning in the parking garage...

597
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:11,349
- why didn't we break this?
- ... Of his apartment building in Washington D.C.

598
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:14,644
U.S. Secret Service Agents
discovered his body after reports

599
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:17,480
- ... that Russo had been missing since Saturday.
- Fuck!

600
00:48:17,481 --> 00:48:20,817
His body was transferred
to the D.C. coroner's office

601
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:25,321
where an autopsy is expected to
confirm his death as a suicide.

602
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,783
A junior congressman from Philadelphia...

603
00:48:27,784 --> 00:48:29,701
- Zoe.
- ... Russo was 36 years old...

604
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:32,370
- Look at this.
- ... And is survived by two children.

605
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:36,291
- I gotta get to the office.
- Russo was in the midst of a heated battle

606
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:38,460
for the governorship of Pennsylvania.

607
00:48:38,461 --> 00:48:41,755
He was last heard publicly during
a morning political radio show

608
00:48:41,756 --> 00:48:44,299
on Pittsburgh station WZPZ.

609
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,636
Now, during the interview, he slurred
his words, he sounded disoriented...

610
00:48:47,637 --> 00:48:49,763
- Christina.
- ... Leading many to believe

611
00:48:49,764 --> 00:48:52,973
- ... that he had relapsed...
- Can you get me a train back to D.C.?

612
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:54,810
Right here on this TV station

613
00:48:54,811 --> 00:48:56,603
for all your late-breaking details

614
00:48:56,604 --> 00:48:58,104
about this major news story:

615
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:01,357
The suicide of congressman Peter Russo.

616
00:51:20,455 --> 00:51:24,793
I find it very difficult to express
everything that I'm feeling right now,

617
00:51:24,794 --> 00:51:27,796
and I know Claire feels exactly the same.

618
00:51:27,797 --> 00:51:30,715
Peter was very special to us.

619
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:33,509
A sort of magnetic presence

620
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,743
that electrified everyone he touched.
