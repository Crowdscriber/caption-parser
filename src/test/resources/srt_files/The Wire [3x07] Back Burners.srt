1
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,249
- All quiet today?
- Keeping it like that, boss.

2
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,451
We rule where we stand.

3
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,394
Police sitting on all corners
over these parts.

4
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,669
- Likely because we been dropping bodies.
- Yeah, they do like that.

5
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,802
But, you know, tomorrow some other
nigga'll stop a bullet somewhere else...

6
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:47,937
and then they'll go stand on a new spot.

7
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:50,846
Boy Marlo closed up shop.

8
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,714
Word is, he wholesaling
his packages for now.

9
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,687
He don't have no crews out here at all?
How about his avenue corners?

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,021
Nigga give up quick, didn't he?

11
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:06,391
Damn, I was just beginning to respect
the little motherfucker for showing heart.

12
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:11,268
All right, listen. When them police roll out,
y'all step in there and take my corners.

13
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,038
I'm on it, B.

14
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:17,368
- Cheese steaks from Bill's.
- Nah, I did that Tuesday, man.

15
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,477
Fuck it then, you pick.

16
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,585
- No, fuck me.
- What?

17
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,593
- Mope in the truck.
- What about him?

18
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:37,194
Think I locked him up.

19
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,789
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Avon what's-his-face?

20
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:43,264
Big player from the projects.
He was the target on that detail...

21
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,566
I worked a couple of years back,
the one I told you about.

22
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,613
- Motherfucker's out already.
- Why, what'd he pull?

23
00:01:54,914 --> 00:01:57,348
Oh, six, eight years.
Who the fuck can remember?

24
00:01:57,717 --> 00:01:59,309
And he's out in two?

25
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,880
Maybe I got the years wrong.

26
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,984
My point is, guy's an asshole.
Locked him up, is all.

27
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,852
- Pit B from the market.
- See, now you're thinking like police.

28
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:51,053
Change in plan.

29
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,428
Bell, you recognize.

30
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,596
Second target is a Marlo Stanfield...

31
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,331
who's apparently warring
with Bell for the West Side corners.

32
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,070
- What about Kintel Williamson?
- That case is on hold for now.

33
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:09,672
On hold? We just managed to ID
the cell phones on two of his people.

34
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:12,044
- Be that as it may...
- I mean, why not take a few more weeks...

35
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,551
so we can put together
what we got on Kintel, you know?

36
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:17,851
We send the case to grand jury
and then we start up this West Side case.

37
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,322
Otherwise, we wasted
more than two months...

38
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,622
Change of target comes to us from
the Commissioner and the Deputy Ops.

39
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,486
The Department is in a reactive mode...

40
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,997
trying to get the murder rate down
by any means necessary.

41
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,500
Kintel was dropping bodies
two months ago.

42
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,935
Today, it's the West Side
that's got the bosses spinning.

43
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,338
Look, I know y'all thought
it was nothing for me to sit on that roof...

44
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,171
day after 90-degree day...

45
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,873
dodging swarms of cicadas and shit,
but, damn, this is fucked up!

46
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:46,281
And all the assets work I did on Kintel,
his cars, his cash flow...

47
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,350
just put that in a drawer?

48
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,261
Someday, I wanna work
for a real police department.

49
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,962
Just to see how the fuck they do it,
you know?

50
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,605
McNulty. In my office.

51
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,309
Hey, Prez, can you
run something out for me?

52
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,444
What?

53
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,957
I need to know who rented this room in
the downtown Hilton, Thursday before last.

54
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,854
Who rented the room?

55
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,621
Address, credit card details,
whatever you can pull.

56
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:35,595
- How's it fit with the case?
- It's hard to say just yet.

57
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,936
Hey, my man. I'm done mowing.

58
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,365
So?

59
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,038
I figured I'd use this to edge
the weeds around the fence.

60
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,114
- It's gas-powered.
- Means I gotta prime it.

61
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,613
You ain't gotta school me but once.

62
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,516
Get some water
before you go back out there.

63
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,587
All right.

64
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,453
You been going hard at it.

65
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,187
You keep showing up at the spot,
I'll keep putting you on.

66
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,889
Good, 'cause I ain't got nothing else.

67
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,933
You walked back through them old doors,
didn't you?

68
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,832
- Tried to.
- Yeah. I had took you for gone.

69
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:19,374
Man, parole officers, employment agencies.

70
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,404
Shit, I just felt like I was an interruption
to their lunch break.

71
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,880
No family?

72
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:30,218
None besides my grandmother.
She put me up in her basement.

73
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,285
That's plenty to ask
of the old girl right there.

74
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,753
You could use somebody to talk to
besides your grand-moms.

75
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,797
What about
one of them social worker types?

76
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,696
I hooked up with one dude. He was cool.

77
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,798
- But, I wasn't ready.
- You look like you're ready now.

78
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,241
I mean, you found an ear to bend,
you wouldn't have to talk to me.

79
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,835
Shit, I know you gonna get tired
of looking at my ugly-ass grill.

80
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,782
Drink that too fast, you'll cramp up.

81
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,085
- You're asking?
- I am.

82
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,184
Lieutenant, I didn't...

83
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:11,093
Because I got no problem changing targets
if that's what the bosses tell me to do.

84
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,923
Unless it's personal,
like when Kima got shot...

85
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,765
I don't care
where we spend our time and money.

86
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,169
Bell, Williamson, whoever.
It's all just police work to me.

87
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:23,304
And I understand that people
above my pay grade...

88
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,639
have the right to make decisions
that are theirs to make.

89
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,372
- And if they're wrong?
- Then they're wrong.

90
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,481
And time will tell, won't it?

91
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,816
Now, I'm asking you for the truth.

92
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:37,484
- You went to Colvin behind my back.
- I'd have gone to the devil himself.

93
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,026
Which way you were standing, Lieutenant,
had not a fucking thing to do with it.

94
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,992
You piece of shit.

95
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,364
I did it 'cause it had to be done.

96
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,924
Just like it had to be done two years ago
when we were first detailed.

97
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,463
Stringer was the target then,
he's still the target now.

98
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:01,702
Lieutenant, you know, as bosses go,
you're better than most...

99
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,740
and I know you went out of your way
to get me off that boat.

100
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:10,081
I know that,
but now we're back on the right man.

101
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,799
Detective McNulty.

102
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,369
When the cuffs go on Stringer,
you need to find a new home.

103
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,115
You're done in this unit.

104
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,686
Your count right?

105
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,025
Yeah, went almost to Richmond
for this here batch.

106
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,992
Yeah, I'm holding.

107
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,558
- You did like we say, right?
- Yeah.

108
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,159
Give him that.

109
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,769
We're gonna need another 60 more
in a couple days.

110
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,637
- 60 more?
- You know how we do.

111
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,267
So, don't be crying, Bernard.

112
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,915
- You must have left something out.
- Fuck, no.

113
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,218
I got the part ones from every sector,
every post.

114
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,726
- We're down about 2%.
- No, where exactly are we down?

115
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,819
Larcenies and burglaries are steady.

116
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,990
But shootings and agg assaults
are both down.

117
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,193
Drug arrests, too,
but I guess that won't look so good.

118
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,034
I mean, where geographically are we down,
in the district?

119
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,577
Well, the posts near the designated
drug zones are up, almost all of them.

120
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,974
That ain't pretty,
but everywhere else it's down.

121
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,515
In some places as much as 4%.

122
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,052
- Bosses gonna love you.
- It's too soon to take any credit.

123
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,823
This might be, what you call that?
A statistical aberration.

124
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:58,158
You ain't gonna let them know that
your little experiment might be working?

125
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,061
Not yet, no.

126
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:02,595
But I'll tell you what we are gonna do.

127
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,603
Starting next week,
I want you to pull one car out of service...

128
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,004
in the quiet posts in every sector,
all three shifts.

129
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,867
We'll take those nine guys...

130
00:10:10,977 --> 00:10:13,377
then use them and double up
on the high crime posts.

131
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,276
If we handle less of it...

132
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,284
we ought to do better
with the crime we got, right?

133
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:28,124
- Can I get two Trac disposable phones?
- They're on special.

134
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,661
- Four for $180.
- Just the two.

135
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,004
The late show out at Westview is 8:45.

136
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,340
We could make that
if we don't make the whole damn run today.

137
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:49,039
Seem to me one phone
is as good as the next.

138
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,776
Only a fool would drive all over the world
when there ain't no need.

139
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,512
Keep on with that shit
and I'm gonna leave your ass in Baltimore.

140
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,716
I don't trust no man on the road
by hisself, okay? I'm not stupid.

141
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,723
Stupid-ass fucker. Commissioner!

142
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,500
How goes it?

143
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:14,762
It went a lot better before the Mayor's
cabinet meeting, I can tell you that.

144
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,136
He rip you?

145
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,303
Says we need to finish under 300
for this year, regardless of how it happens.

146
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:23,075
- Now, I tried to tell...
- Erv, let me ask you.

147
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,083
Where do you guys stand
on this Witness Assistance thing?

148
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,381
What?

149
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:33,117
Overhauling the city's
Witness Assistance Program?

150
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,586
Nobody from the Mayor's office
called you...

151
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,130
regarding this problem
of witnesses getting killed?

152
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,030
I got a call from Chief of Staff
a week ago, yeah.

153
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:46,798
But all he said was I should try not
to have any more witnesses get killed.

154
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,967
But overhauling the program?

155
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,906
Unless someone wants to spend
a lot more money...

156
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,501
there's not a whole hell of a lot
my people can do.

157
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,944
And you haven't talked
to the Mayor directly on this?

158
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,148
You're not gonna fuck me on this?
As it is, I got the Mayor's teeth in my ass.

159
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,449
Your name does not get mentioned.

160
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,824
Mayor didn't say a word to me.

161
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,960
Thanks.

162
00:12:14,266 --> 00:12:18,430
<i>... is nothing.</i>
<i>This is DC 's number one, WPGC 95.5.</i>

163
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,310
Where the fuck we at now?

164
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,613
Just buy four or five, Bernard.
Do it like that and it'll go twice as quick.

165
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,550
I want a Shrek Slurpee, Bernard,
and some Krispy Kreme.

166
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,892
All this
from one disposable cell phone, huh?

167
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,660
And a dead one, too.

168
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:53,637
It was used by Marlo's people
and picked up off the ground by Kima's CI.

169
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,401
Problem is it's just raw data.
We need to firm up...

170
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:00,172
what we know about Marlo's operation
with surveillance and CI info.

171
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,073
On the other hand...

172
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:06,117
if we had a burner that we knew was used
by one of Stringer's players...

173
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,618
we could use what we know
about that organization...

174
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,382
to make all kinds of connections.

175
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,424
Get us one good phone,
we'll give you the network.

176
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,785
- That's the good news.
- And what's the bad?

177
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:21,293
It's all historical.
We can give you the network, no problem...

178
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,328
but by then it's a week old
and they've dumped their phones.

179
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:29,669
And how we get a wire up on that,
I haven't figured out yet.

180
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,670
Well, see that you do, Detective.

181
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:46,916
Oh, yeah, you keep this job,
I'm gonna gain some serious weight.

182
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,960
- Just the two?
- Just the two.

183
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,961
Nigga, you ain't never heard
of buying in bulk?

184
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:52,758
You could be saving them people
all kind of money.

185
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,765
Better still, spending it on me.

186
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,247
- Why you got a gun, Bernard?
- Oh, you ain't heard?

187
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,790
- Avon's home, so we tooling up.
- You ain't the only one on parole.

188
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,725
- You riding my last good nerve.
- And that ain't the only thing I can ride.

189
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,728
Just get me back to the interstate.

190
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,358
Big white bag, got the big white bag.

191
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,568
- Which one is he again?
- Broadus, street name of Bodie.

192
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:37,239
He used to be in the low-rises.
Had a Tower later on.

193
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,609
Big white, got the big white.

194
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,278
How many more minutes you think
he's got on that phone?

195
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,754
- Fuck this, let's hit the bar.
- Lester needs a phone, man.

196
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,431
No, there's an easier way.
I'll show you tomorrow.

197
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,228
Come on.

198
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,035
I'm buying.

199
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:18,648
Big white bag, got the big white bag.

200
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,616
She just wants me to be happy, you know?

201
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,325
And I mean,
I do the same for her when I can.

202
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,691
Like this thing with the police detective.

203
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:36,063
Brianna says she wants me
to go downtown with her and...

204
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:38,959
I don't know, hear the man out about D.

205
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:43,139
And I know there ain't nothing to it,
but she is all upset, you know?

206
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,076
And I tried to tell her what you told me.

207
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:50,608
But, she say she wanna go down there
and talk to him herself, I guess.

208
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,514
- You told her about the cop?
- What?

209
00:15:53,652 --> 00:15:56,416
About the detective.
What you told me, you told her?

210
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,012
It's her son, right?

211
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,988
I mean, ain't she got a right to know
what's going on?

212
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:05,560
- Look, I just thought...
- What?

213
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,630
Why the fuck you gonna get her all upset
over some bullshit?

214
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,671
Here we are a fucking year later,
everybody forgot about the shit...

215
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,603
you go running your mouth
about nothing at all?

216
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,040
- But, String...
- What, and she gonna believe that shit, too.

217
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,408
I mean, what moms is not gonna believe
her son didn't kill hisself?

218
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,538
- String...
- Huh? She gonna take that shit...

219
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,276
go half-crazy with it.

220
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,778
- I just...
- You just what?

221
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,345
Sorry!

222
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,403
- When you tell her that?
- About a week ago, I guess.

223
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,410
When is she gonna go see the cop?

224
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:57,043
Think she gonna talk to a lawyer first,
ask him how to play it.

225
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,050
- Who, Levy?
- I guess, whoever.

226
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,779
- The lawyer.
- Levy?

227
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,154
- I guess.
- Oh, you didn't ask that?

228
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:21,302
And this fucking Royce just lets it slide.
I mean, I go to him, right?

229
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,238
Not to make points,
just to do the right thing...

230
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,640
what does he do
but blow smoke up my ass.

231
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,576
"I'm glad you came to us with this, Tommy.

232
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,343
"Oh, I'll light a fire, don't you worry.
We gotta move on this."

233
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,684
I never thought he'd have the balls
to just fuck the dog on it.

234
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:39,983
- And you were doing the right thing.
- Fuck, yeah.

235
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,951
What?

236
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,822
You went there hoping
that Royce would disappoint.

237
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,694
You want to know that you're better,
that you deserve his chair.

238
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,667
If I lie down on this couch,
do you charge by the hour?

239
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,530
Thanks.

240
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,397
You're not naive. Neither am I.

241
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,267
A man doesn't run for office
without being a bit self-righteous first.

242
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:03,177
Self-righteous? Me?

243
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,374
So, what are you gonna do now?

244
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,610
Call a reporter or two, rip the Mayor,
maybe on background...

245
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,017
maybe go on the record, I don't know.

246
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,057
Rip him now?
With the primary next September?

247
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,990
Tommy, no one's gonna remember
a dead witness a year from now.

248
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:21,192
Better if you go to Royce,
confront him, not angrily...

249
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,664
give him a chance to explain
or maybe take action.

250
00:18:24,803 --> 00:18:27,135
If he does do something,
then a problem got fixed...

251
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:31,539
and you can feel special for helping.
If he doesn't, you sit tight.

252
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:35,005
I don't know. Maybe you document
your meeting in a letter...

253
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,378
expressing your concern and regret.

254
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,644
Then you're set
if the next witness gets killed.

255
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:43,581
Win-win.

256
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,952
- Unless you're the witness.
- I know, you're right.

257
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:52,123
But he's taking on a two-term incumbent.
It's all gonna be ugly from here.

258
00:18:58,504 --> 00:18:59,698
All right.

259
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,270
Yeah, it's cool.

260
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:10,909
- Need another 30 by Monday, all right?
- All right.

261
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,408
Yeah.

262
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,813
Forgot this.

263
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,521
Bitch, everything I say,
you hear backwards.

264
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,889
Stupid motherfucker.

265
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,761
Got them T's, white and bright!

266
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:33,166
- One for $3, two for $5.
- Blue tops, got them blue tops!

267
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:38,533
I got them T's.
White, bright, one for $3, two for $5.

268
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:54,050
- I got this, man, $5. New.
- No, thank you, man.

269
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:55,592
- It's only $5.
- No, thank you.

270
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,686
Fuck you, then, man, fuck you. Fuck you.

271
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,167
I got <i>them...</i>

272
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,938
I got them. I got them T's.

273
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:27,355
Red tops, red tops, got them red tops!

274
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,628
Rockefeller, got some Rockefeller, hey!

275
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,067
Hey, seller man, what you got?

276
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,377
Got the long white T's for the young ones.

277
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,106
You ain't got no candles?
I'm looking to buy candles...

278
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,614
and toilet paper for the shit-bucket, too.

279
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,144
- You be back here tomorrow?
- I can't leave.

280
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,519
- I leave, somebody grab my stake.
- I'll be back tomorrow.

281
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,082
Yo, Johnny.

282
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:36,819
What's up, Bubs?

283
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,127
Shit, Johnny, man.

284
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,437
Just been chasing the pipe, you know?

285
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:50,631
Shit's got me all digging and scratching
in my arms.

286
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:52,668
You know, it's cool.

287
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,140
All right.
Come on, man, you need a break, all right?

288
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,079
I'm serious, man, you need a break.
Come on, man.

289
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,980
No, man, look around you.

290
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,921
It's a soldier's paradise, man.

291
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,664
I'm a Viking, Bubs.

292
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,673
Are you a Viking?

293
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,621
Fuck, not again.

294
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,685
- You two coming?
- Major said to bring them down here.

295
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:48,391
He didn't say shit about playing nursemaid
to a bunch of goddamn animals.

296
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,101
Push it back. Get back,
push it back.

297
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:03,913
- Should we cuff them, Sarge?
- No, cut them loose.

298
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,650
The fuck we tell you
about fighting down here?

299
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,752
Only rule is no fighting,
no cutting, no shooting!

300
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,483
Y'all still fuck it up.

301
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:16,186
Next time you make me come down here,
see if I don't call for a 10-38.

302
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,397
Just so you know, dickhead,
that's an ambulance.

303
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:22,757
Break it up, break it up, break it up.

304
00:24:04,176 --> 00:24:07,339
- Did I wake the baby?
- You would know if you did.

305
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,116
3:00 in the morning.
Nice of you to check in.

306
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:15,543
- I went out after work to unwind.
- Yeah, you look unwound.

307
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,782
Well.

308
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,792
I figured you had everything under control
on the home front.

309
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,453
What the fuck is wrong with you?

310
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:30,134
What's with the sarcasm? How come
you can talk to everybody else but me?

311
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,403
Do you really want to know?

312
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,306
I'm listening.

313
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,706
I miss us.

314
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:44,180
Do not blame that baby. Do not do it.

315
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:47,445
- I'm not blaming anybody.
- I didn't do this by myself.

316
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,244
- We discussed it, all of it.
- We talked about it, yeah.

317
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,016
But...

318
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,025
I didn't have
as much to say about it as you.

319
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:03,163
- And why not?
- Because <i>you...</i>

320
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:07,529
You wanted this.

321
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,377
I <i>just...</i>
I didn't want to disappoint you on it.

322
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,953
Well, I don't think I could be
more disappointed than I am right now.

323
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,718
You need to go.

324
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,545
How much you got?

325
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,853
Quiet overnight?

326
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:07,398
Midnight shift had to toss a crew
that was casing the place.

327
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:09,364
Other than <i>that...</i>

328
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,469
Too many damn children.

329
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,437
What do you need lookouts and runners for
if the shit is legal?

330
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,010
A lot of them have been cut loose
by the dealers.

331
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,603
It's like one of those nature shows.
When you mess with the environment...

332
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,979
some species get fucked
out of their habitat.

333
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,279
Did you just use the word "habitat"
in a sentence?

334
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,546
I did.

335
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,530
- Letting your lookouts go, huh?
- My runners, too.

336
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,498
Shit, what's the point?

337
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,732
So, here you are
making money hand over fist...

338
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:48,203
and you're too damn greedy
to take care of your workforce.

339
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:51,139
- I don't need them.
- But they need you, right?

340
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,573
You was all they had
when you couldn't work a corner...

341
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:54,804
except for touts and runners...

342
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,245
then it was cool to have them cut school
and work out.

343
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,886
- Okay, new tax initiative, my brother.
- Say what?

344
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,958
If you wanna sling
in Hamsterdam after today...

345
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,050
you and every other knucklehead,
you each got to kick in $100 a week.

346
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:14,257
- Oh, so you trying to get paid, huh?
- Not me, not for me.

347
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,566
Get the cash up, I'll be back.

348
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,301
Green tops! What's up? Green tops!

349
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:25,531
Got the green tops.

350
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,017
But it ain't something
I'm gonna go to jail for, right?

351
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,992
I mean, it ain't nothing like that, is it?

352
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,001
- That one?
- No, it was more black than silver.

353
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,403
This one, I think.

354
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,046
I can see y'all got some real ugly shit
planned for me.

355
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,818
I can see it.

356
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,882
You just bumped up against
a clever police is all.

357
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,818
Course, he gonna try to shame you
with the dead girl...

358
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:23,094
or some mess about children looking up
to Omar and his sawed-off.

359
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,862
All he can do...

360
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,461
especially since you backed down
what he had for a witness.

361
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,500
He working you with guilt, boy.

362
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,403
Yeah, but that fat man gave me
a itch I can't scratch, Butchie.

363
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,812
Oh, everybody in this world does
what they going to.

364
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,644
Me, you, the police.

365
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,819
Everybody in this world
got their own place.

366
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:50,526
And a man in your line of work start
worrying about how other people see you.

367
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:55,058
Playing to other people
instead of to hisself, he gonna get dead.

368
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,872
I still feel like I owe something, Butch.

369
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,514
I had a uncle down Carolina, he dead now...

370
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:16,276
but I remember he was grieving real hard...

371
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,515
real hard over chasing his ladyfriend away.

372
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,524
So, he put himself to punishment.

373
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:26,324
Took a knife to his little finger,
then his ring finger.

374
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:30,260
With them all bloody on the table,
he pulled up short.

375
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,863
For the rest of his life...

376
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:38,431
I remember him saying, "The bitch wasn't
worth more than a pinkie."

377
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:44,238
But it was too late then.
You can try that if you got a mind.

378
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:49,920
I don't know, Butch.
A little something less dramatical.

379
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:52,221
You feel me?

380
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,753
You told Brianna
she could go downtown with this?

381
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,352
D'Angelo's her son,
how was I gonna stop her?

382
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,900
Look. Look, there's no harm done if
she keeps her mouth shut and just listens.

383
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,696
No, it's fucked up.

384
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,128
There ain't no call
messing with Brianna with this bullshit.

385
00:30:08,239 --> 00:30:09,604
- What can you do?
- I don't know.

386
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:12,369
File a complaint against the detective
or some shit. I don't know.

387
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,569
Harassment?

388
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,476
Look, this is the same motherfucker
that had Avon's case.

389
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,775
Same motherfucker that's coming at me
in my print shop, talking shit...

390
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:22,546
and now, he coming at Brianna
with this bullshit?

391
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,249
A complaint's not going to do anything.
And the fact is...

392
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,259
if the cops are saying
her son might not be a suicide...

393
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,658
Brianna's gonna hear this out, regardless.

394
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:35,423
I suppose Avon should know
about it, though.

395
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,534
Yeah, well, I'll handle that.

396
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,016
- Not much slinging going on here.
- Western boys are sitting on the real estate.

397
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:06,260
Yeah. All right. All right.
That'll work too. All right.

398
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,757
Yo, Shamrock says we should take some
of our people...

399
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,801
down to Hamsterdam and sell off there.

400
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,871
At least, until these narcos roll up
off some of these corners.

401
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,365
- Come on.
- Yeah. Yeah. Come on.

402
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,609
- Car stop, maybe?
- Why not?

403
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,861
- Hey, motherfucker.
- Got it right here, yo!

404
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:40,359
Get that pink top, yo.

405
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,300
Not yet, you fucking rodent!

406
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,847
Y'all can't do this, man.
We headed to Hamsterdam.

407
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:07,982
You come off that car again...

408
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,458
you headed to Bon Secours
emergency room. You hear me?

409
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,724
Yo, Officer, we got immunity from y'all.
We going to the free zone.

410
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,890
What the fuck's a free zone?

411
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,003
Package for sale.

412
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,537
I'm saying, straight up. Why you think
we was headed there in the first place?

413
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:25,131
- Get down. Headed where?
- Hamsterdam.

414
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:27,100
Suck my dick!

415
00:32:33,051 --> 00:32:36,418
- Hey, y'all wanna see a wagon?
- Fuck y'all!

416
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,046
Will you shut the fuck up
and cut this shit out now?

417
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:49,556
Like you said.

418
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:55,162
That's your receipt.
$244 for the hoop comes back to me...

419
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,741
rounded to $250 for my gas money.

420
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,075
This repays me.

421
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:04,670
And the rest of this?
Use it to pay them hoppers for the week.

422
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:07,580
Whether you use them or not,
you pay this money out.

423
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:11,314
This shit is like unemployment insurance.
Every employer gotta pay in.

424
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:12,989
If I find out anybody been holding out...

425
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:16,151
then he's out of here,
back in the street getting his head busted.

426
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,388
The least you all can do
is look after your own people a little bit.

427
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,723
What are you, a fucking communist?

428
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,997
<i>23-04. Need a couple of 10-16s</i>
<i>to Fayette, west of Vincent.</i>

429
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,335
- That's right around the corner from here.
<i>- 10-4. Units responding.</i>

430
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,516
- What the fuck happened?
- Car stop.

431
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,644
I got a g-pack from beneath
the passenger seat.

432
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,848
Yo, we was on our way to Hamsterdam.

433
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,755
The man say we don't get no hassle
coming in or going out. What's up?

434
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,920
- What the fuck is Hamsterdam?
- Lying-ass police!

435
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,456
I can't let you do this.

436
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,658
- Carv, they got a g-pack.
- On the way to the free zone, they did.

437
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,133
- You know the rules.
- Yeah, man...

438
00:33:58,236 --> 00:34:00,830
- and I was trying to tell these people...
- Just shut the fuck up.

439
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,372
<i>... to any unit at the scene</i>
<i>at Fayette and Vincent.</i>

440
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,801
- Yeah, boss?
<i>- You got a situation there?</i>

441
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,775
- I can't believe this bullshit.
- Yeah, bullshit is right.

442
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,078
- I told you to shut the fuck up.
- Yo, man, you gave us y'all fucking word!

443
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,618
You know you did, man.
This is some fucking bullshit.

444
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,914
Y'all some fucking liars, man.

445
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:19,990
Carv, will you please tell me
what the fuck is going on here?

446
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,388
Major said he's on his way.

447
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,892
Carv?

448
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:32,361
Oh, man.

449
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,446
- You sure that's the one?
- Reesie say that was the one.

450
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,611
Who am I to say different?

451
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,489
Tell him I ain't gonna pay
till it proves itself, though.

452
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:01,122
I told him that already.
He say $1,500 for his troubles.

453
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,161
Damn.

454
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,193
Conscience do cost.

455
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:30,252
I seen him, Bernard.
You hadn't even gone past the damn door...

456
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,794
and he threw all them papers in the trash.

457
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:35,354
- You lying now, I could tell.
- You is the only one who gives a fuck...

458
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,492
and if you hadn't been the stupidest
motherfucker that I ever gone out with...

459
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:40,730
you just would have bought
a whole bunch of them things at once.

460
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,830
I only need like six more.
We be done in like a half an hour.

461
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:47,638
How about we make one more stop,
you get six of them shits...

462
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:50,179
and I suck your dick
for the next 20 minutes.

463
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,630
Got you.

464
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,997
Oh, fuck.

465
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,806
Oh, fuck you all.

466
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:20,210
- Shit, I worked a double, man.
- Yeah, right.

467
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,905
- Bunk, line three.
- All right.

468
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,482
Tack it to the board, Mike,
you know the rules.

469
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,513
- Detective Moreland.
<i>- Heard you looking for something.</i>

470
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:37,160
Let me get some
of them Trac phones activated.

471
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,126
Eight of them bitches.

472
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,641
This one's for Sector Two.

473
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,139
Sector One, I'm using
that empty low-rise housing on Winchester.

474
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,747
- Sector Three, the old Koppers plant.
- And it's legal to sell here?

475
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,840
- Sector Three, the old Koppers plant.
- And it's legal to sell here?

476
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,247
It's not legal.

477
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:04,419
- We just look the other way is all.
- How? How can you?

478
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,387
Look, I know it hurts your head
to think about...

479
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,549
but before you decide
to lose your mind on this...

480
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:12,058
take a moment, ride around to my corners,
my worst drug corners.

481
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:15,860
Edmondson and Brice. North and Pulaski.
Hollins and Payson.

482
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,996
They're empty. All of them.

483
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,636
District-wide, my crime is down 5%.

484
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,039
- But do the bosses know?
- No, the bosses don't know shit about it.

485
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:29,374
Look, this is just a District Commander
taking initiative on his own.

486
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,913
Jesus Christ!

487
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,643
I knew it was a matter of time...

488
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,049
before I bumped into somebody
from downtown about this.

489
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:39,554
And I know your natural impulse is to take
what you saw back downtown with you.

490
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,057
- But I got to ask you...
- You legalized drugs!

491
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,957
Look, this is a tactical deployment.

492
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,862
We just wait for everything to get
settled down here in these three zones...

493
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,456
and then we move.

494
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:55,530
Look, we make a big show of locking
everybody up and then we shut it down.

495
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:02,542
I'm sorry I had to fuck you up
on that arrest.

496
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,509
And I'm sorry you had to see me
give that runt back the g-pack.

497
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,176
That was ugly, I know.

498
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:15,484
But I'm just trying to save what's left
of my district any way I can, if I can.

499
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:19,359
And the longer I have before I have to brief
the bosses about this deployment...

500
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,432
We got all we needed
from the car stop, Major. Don't sweat it.

501
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,237
Let me get a word with my old Commander.

502
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,340
I don't know, Major.

503
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,145
Whenever you bust this place up,
they'll go back to their same corners.

504
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,481
Besides, you were never much
on making a big show.

505
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:49,491
If this doesn't work, Jimmy,
I mean, it's just back to usual.

506
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,857
I'm out the door on pension anyway.

507
00:38:53,464 --> 00:38:55,432
Jimmy, I need more time.

508
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:59,503
I need to be able to rely on you
and your people to keep this close.

509
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,237
Bosses don't know, huh?

510
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,812
Fuck the bosses.

511
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,752
You the man who called?

512
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:31,427
I did.

513
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,140
You witnessing or what?

514
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,177
I'm afraid I'm blind.

515
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,444
Legally.

516
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,723
Something you need to see, though.

517
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,628
Glock .40, I believe.

518
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,243
I suppose you ain't going to tell me
who brought this here, right?

519
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:21,807
Like I said, I'm blind.

520
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,423
I thought you might know, though.

521
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,625
You can tell him from me...

522
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,796
I'm hoping he might need this
in court some day.

523
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:58,016
Man, narcos might come back.

524
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:03,123
They might.
But until they do, this your corner to hold.

525
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,757
- What about Marlo's crew?
- Look, Avon's home...

526
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,797
and you on a Barksdale corner.
You feel me?

527
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,865
- Avon ain't here now.
- You got muscle.

528
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,063
Don't worry about that, little man.

529
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,706
Hey.

530
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:32,119
The burner of young Bodie Broadus.
Still has minutes left.

531
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,789
Speed dial?

532
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:43,464
Caroline.

533
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:46,263
You wouldn't have an extra room
at your place, would you?

534
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,507
Just for a night or two
till I can get my shit together.

535
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:54,806
- Ain't no fixing it?
- It's fixed pretty good, I think.

536
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,344
Thanks.

537
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:08,519
Credit card was a business account
listed to a Theresa D'Agostino.

538
00:42:08,659 --> 00:42:10,251
Yeah, that's her.

539
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,659
What kind of business?

540
00:42:12,763 --> 00:42:15,596
Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.

541
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,135
Billing on the card goes to a business
address in northwest Washington.

542
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,535
I called the switchboard and she's listed.

543
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:30,236
D'Agostino doesn't sound much like
a West Baltimore name to me.

544
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,644
Me, either.

545
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,583
Truth is, I don't know what I want.

546
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:43,592
I know I'm looking for something,
but I can't even tell you what it is.

547
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:49,866
- I understand you found work.
- Ain't no payroll job, but it'll do.

548
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:56,371
You ain't here for a job
or the GED program.

549
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,075
So, you looking to join the church?

550
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:07,215
I <i>just...</i>

551
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:11,582
I've had this feeling for a long time...

552
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:16,989
and it's like I'm standing outside myself...

553
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:20,760
watching me do things
I don't wanna do, you know?

554
00:43:22,132 --> 00:43:25,158
Just seeing me like I'm somebody else...

555
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,998
but never, ever
being able to stop the show.

556
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,673
I'm tired.

557
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,840
It's Cutty, right?

558
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:39,781
No, man.

559
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:42,618
Dennis.

560
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,017
- She's left, huh?
<i>- She's out of the office.</i>

561
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:48,016
I figured that,
'cause I'm supposed to meet her, actually.

562
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,516
Tonight, yeah.

563
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,053
Right, exactly.

564
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,600
Well, I was going to pick her up
and take her to that, but I'm running late.

565
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:03,469
<i>- Her plans may have changed.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

566
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,805
Where is that exactly?
I'm not real familiar with that part <i>of...</i>

567
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:10,346
<i>It's on the corner of 15th Street and...</i>

568
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,809
Okay.

569
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,910
Too many damn
scheduling conflicts, unfortunately.

570
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,716
But we have put it on the agenda
for the next meeting...

571
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,518
of the Coordinating Council
on Criminal Justice.

572
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:23,616
You're sentencing it to committee?

573
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,226
Mr. Mayor, we're probably only talking, like,
a few hundred thousand to start.

574
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,027
I'm not saying we should
create new identities for these people...

575
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:33,467
send them to New Mexico like the Feds.
We just need to get them out of harm's way.

576
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,867
Let me tell you something, Councilman.

577
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,099
I can't lay my hands
on several hundred thousand dollars...

578
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:38,231
that's not already spoken for.

579
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,140
- Mr. Mayor, I was not...
- What would you have me do, Councilman?

580
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,406
Should I divert the money
that's already been budgeted...

581
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,846
for snow removal
from the First District this winter?

582
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,611
Or how about I reduce trash pickup
to once a week citywide...

583
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,414
put the witnesses up
at the Hyatt Inner Harbor?

584
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,850
I'm not trying to be difficult.
Tommy, come on.

585
00:44:57,494 --> 00:45:01,988
The city in the financial situation it's in?
Very few friends in Annapolis.

586
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,999
We've done all we could do
with this matter for now.

587
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,300
Okay, then.

588
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:13,169
Well, thanks for your time. Gentlemen.

589
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,738
Ah, what the fuck.

590
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,619
I don't know, boss. If there weren't
so many fucking kids down here...

591
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,517
I might be okay with it.

592
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,500
- Baltimore police.
- Baltimore?

593
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,464
Baltimore, Maryland.

594
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:27,347
- Can I get a Jameson?
- Bushmills okay?

595
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,682
- That's Protestant whiskey.
- The price is right, isn't it?

596
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:32,388
Make it neat.

597
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,144
Excuse me.

598
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,258
- Hey.
- Hey.

599
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,756
- What are you doing here?
- Just asking myself the same thing.

600
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:18,427
You drive all the way down here...

601
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:20,435
to look at me from across the room
and then leave?

602
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,801
- That's kind of creepy.
- You looked occupied.

603
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,874
Him? Honey, that's just business.

604
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,308
- This ain't my kind of crowd.
- Definitely not.

605
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:30,880
Yeah, well, I made a mistake, so I better go.

606
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:35,214
- 428?
- You live in this town.

607
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,547
- Why book the room?
- I live across town.

608
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:41,123
As late as these things go,
that's a DUI away.

609
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,426
- Give me two hours, McNulty?
- What am I gonna do for two hours?

610
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,595
Dream on it.

611
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,261
Water fresh?

612
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,938
You keeping them cool?

613
00:48:00,477 --> 00:48:02,877
You got squeakers nesting squabs.

614
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,048
Taking care of the young'uns.
I like seeing that.

615
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:11,279
Yeah, Marlo, he's real loyal.

616
00:48:11,521 --> 00:48:14,684
- I can't kick him off that nest.
- This is good work.

617
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:19,221
- This is really good work.
- Police coming off them corners.

618
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:21,257
I seen.

619
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:27,226
Gonna keep my name off the package
for a time, gonna keep wholesaling.

620
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,129
You know, step back a bit.

621
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:34,834
Barksdale gonna think we weak,
not coming out to claim what's ours.

622
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:39,407
The police leave them corners,
he's gonna be back out there.

623
00:48:39,516 --> 00:48:41,006
I know he will.

624
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:50,184
- Your turn, girl.
- It's about time. For real.

625
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,363
For starters...

626
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:58,195
its memory holds the last 10 calls
made and received by the user.

627
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,998
- That's enough to give us a signature.
- Signature?

628
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:03,197
The phone number's unique
to an individual.

629
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:07,141
That way we can identify the user
when he switches to another phone.

630
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:10,111
Sorry, I'm late. Woke up in the wrong town.

631
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:14,410
Anyway, we ran the tolls
on those numbers...

632
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,419
and we came up with
a rather interesting pattern.

633
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:20,955
Check this out. This is the pattern
of a closed communication network.

634
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,788
Something you'd expect
from a drug organization.

635
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:26,385
This particular one so far involves...

636
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:30,227
- 15 distinct burners.
- 15.

637
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,931
And none of them
list subscriber information.

638
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:35,629
- You can do that?
- With these burners...

639
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,140
with this particular company,
you don't need subscriber information.

640
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:43,573
Our data shows that over 92% of the calls...

641
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,980
were made within this network, with
the average call lasting less than a minute.

642
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:50,645
Again, suggestive of drug trafficking.

643
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:55,016
Now, this user here,
he serves as a clearing house.

644
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,925
He receives calls and initiates interactions.
He coordinates the show.

645
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,759
- Nice if that was Stringer.
- Now, this is the best part.

646
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,663
This is something that Prez discovered
when he was playing with it.

647
00:50:04,768 --> 00:50:07,532
It has a speed dial feature.

648
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:16,209
Meaning, someone took the time
to program the phone.

649
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:20,044
Hell, that's probably the only way these
corner boys can remember all the numbers.

650
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:22,744
What with these phones
being dumped every few days or so.

651
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,389
I'll bet all the other phones in the network
are set up the same way.

652
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,323
Well, I've heard enough.
We should start writing for the wire.

653
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,223
- When can we get up?
- Get up on what?

654
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,556
They're dumping phones
every couple of weeks on average.

655
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:36,188
By the time you get a wire up on that,
the phones are dead.

656
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:39,530
The whole network
shuts down simultaneously.

657
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:44,203
- Do we have a plan?
- Not yet, we don't.

658
00:50:44,307 --> 00:50:47,071
But, for now, if I could get
a couple more of these dead phones...

659
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,668
it'd probably help corroborate the theory
for the affidavit.

660
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,874
Kima, maybe you could ask those
Western boys to pick up what they find...

661
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:55,474
- on the ground for the next few days. Huh?
- Yeah, sure.

662
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,815
Damn, boy, you smell like sex.

663
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:06,123
- You didn't take a fucking shower?
- I was late for work.

664
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:16,701
- Forgot my Newports, didn't you?
- Oh, shit, man, I did, yo.

665
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,571
Let me do these chips
and then I'll go get your cigarettes.

666
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:02,411
<i>3- 1 on shooting of this number one male.</i>

667
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,213
<i>- We're gonna need 10-100 down here.</i>
<i>- Copy that... I'm on my way.</i>

668
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:10,017
<i>- Roger, 700.</i>
- Back so soon?

669
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,925
I thought you guys had enough
of our happy district yesterday.

670
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,631
Just need a favor.
Lester wants you to scoop up...

671
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:18,701
any discarded cell phones
you find on Barksdale corners.

672
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:21,362
You want Barksdale's license plates.
Tag numbers and all?

673
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,699
Whatever, sure.

674
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,036
'Cause I saw big man
riding in a truck the other day.

675
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,235
Missed the tags, but if I see him again...

676
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:29,539
- Stringer?
- No, the other guy.

677
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,080
- What other guy?
- Big boy, the one we locked up.

678
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,647
- Avon.
- Avon Barksdale?

679
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:38,482
Jesus, Herc. He's at Jessup,
down for four or five at least.

680
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:42,089
- What, we all look alike to you?
- Lf you don't believe me, fuck it.

681
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:43,682
No fucking way.

682
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:48,990
But the fact remains, we would not
be returning this service weapon...

683
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:53,798
to this officer without help
from the citizens of Baltimore as well.

684
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:58,603
And on that note, I think our Mayor
would like to say a few words.

685
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:04,912
Thank you, Commissioner Burrell.

686
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,007
I just want to take this opportunity
to commend our department...

687
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:11,315
on successfully resolving this case...

688
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:15,522
and to wish Officer Dozerman
a speedy return to duty.

689
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:22,624
<i>Officer Dozerman,</i>
<i>the citizens want you to have this back...</i>

690
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:28,401
<i>and to thank you for your service</i>
<i>in defense of our city.</i>

691
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:34,809
<i>And I especially want to thank</i>
<i>all of our concerned residents...</i>

692
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,108
<i>who called in to the hotline.</i>
<i>We would not be here today...</i>

693
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,765
- Lester.
- Lieutenant, you gotta see this.

694
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:12,543
Big joke.
