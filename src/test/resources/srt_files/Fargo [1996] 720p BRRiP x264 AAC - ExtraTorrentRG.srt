1
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:41,181
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

2
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,889
- You're Jerry Lundegaard?
- Yah.

3
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:45,946
Shep Proudfoot said ...

3
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:49,446
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. 
What gives, man?

4
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:51,191
Shep said 8:30.

5
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:54,200
We've been here an hour.
He's peed three times already.

6
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:59,826
Aw. I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8:30.
It was a mix-up, I guess.

7
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:03,036
- You got the car?
- Yah, you bet. Its out in the lot there.

8
00:04:03,128 --> 00:04:07,340
- Brand-new, burnt-umber Ciera.
- Yeah, OK. Well, sit down, then.

9
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:11,668
I'm Carl Showalter.
This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

10
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:13,220
Yah. How ya doin'?

11
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:17,552
- So, we all set on this thing, then?
- Sure, Jerry. Why wouldn't we be?

12
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:23,146
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are. Shep vouched
for you. I've got every confidence in you.

13
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:31,238
I guess that's it, then. 
Here are the keys.

14
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:33,030
No, that's not it, Jerry.

15
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:36,450
- Huh?
- The new vehicle, plus $40,000.

16
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:42,455
Yah, but the deal was the car first, then
the $40,000, like as if it was the ransom.

17
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:45,413
- I thought Shep told you.
- Shep didn't tell us much.

18
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:48,706
- Well, OK. Its ...
- Except that you'd be here at 7.30.

19
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:51,715
- Yah, that was a mix-up.
- Yeah. You already said that.

20
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:55,501
Yah. But its not
a whole pay-in-advance deal.

21
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:59,843
See, I give you a brand-new vehicle
in advance, and then ...

22
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:02,603
- I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
- OK.

23
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,762
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

24
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:08,521
I will say this, though. What Shep 
told us didn't make a lot of sense.

25
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,527
Oh, no, its real sound. 
Its all worked out.

26
00:05:12,363 --> 00:05:15,779
- You want your own wife kidnapped?
- Yah.

27
00:05:17,244 --> 00:05:19,034
You ...

28
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,366
My point is, you pay the ransom,
what, 80,000 bucks?

29
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:27,289
I mean, you give us half 
the ransom — $40,000. You keep half.

30
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:30,083
Its like robbin' Peter to pay Paul.
Makes no sense.

31
00:05:30,172 --> 00:05:33,623
OK. See, its not me paying the ransom.

32
00:05:33,718 --> 00:05:38,095
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.
Her dad, he's real well-off.

33
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,346
- Now, I'm in trouble.
- What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

34
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:46,559
Well, that's ... I'm not gonna get 
into ... See, I just need the money.

35
00:05:46,647 --> 00:05:50,478
- Now, her dad, he's real well-off.
- So why not just ask him for the money?

36
00:05:50,568 --> 00:05:53,402
- Or your fucking wife.
- Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

37
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:55,361
Well ...

38
00:05:55,448 --> 00:05:57,523
Its all part of this ...

39
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,161
They don't know I need it, see.
OK, so there's that.

40
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:05,995
And even if they did, I wouldn't 
get it. So there's that on top, then.

41
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:08,656
- These are personal matters.
- Personal matters?

42
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:11,788
Yah. Personal matters 
that needn't ...

43
00:06:11,881 --> 00:06:17,717
OK, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform 
this mission, but you won't ...

44
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:20,174
You won't ...

45
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,176
Oh, fuck it. 
Lets take a look at that Ciera.

47
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:35,524
- Hon!
- Hi, hon. Welcome back.

48
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:38,812
- How was Fargo?
- Yah. Real good.

49
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,155
Dad's here.

50
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,365
- How ya doin', Wade?
- Yah. Pretty good.

51
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,535
- What you watchin' there?
- Gophers.

52
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,915
Who they playin'?

53
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:05,258
- Is he stayin' for supper, then?
- Yah, I think so. Dad?

54
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:07,223
- What?
- You stayin' for supper?

55
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,184
Yeah.

56
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,311
- May I be excused?
- What?

57
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,774
- You done there?
- Uh-huh. I'm going out.

58
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:22,864
- Where are you going?
- Just McDonald's.

59
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,025
- Back at 9.30.
- OK.

60
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:29,824
He just ate. He didn't finish. He's going
to McDonald's instead of finishing here.

61
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:33,658
- He sees his friends there. Its OK.
- Its OK, McDonald's?

62
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,453
What do you think they do there?
They don't drink milkshakes!

63
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:39,623
Its OK, Dad.

64
00:07:45,556 --> 00:07:49,553
Wade, have you had a chance to think
about that deal I was talkin' about?

65
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:53,142
- Those 40 acres there on Wayzata?
- You told me about it.

66
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:56,764
Yah. You said you'd think about it.
I understand its a lot of money.

67
00:07:56,859 --> 00:07:59,812
Its a heck of a lot.
What did you want to put there?

68
00:07:59,904 --> 00:08:02,608
- A lot. Its a limited ...
- I know its a lot.

69
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:07,692
- I mean a parking lot.
- Yeah, well, $750,000 is a lot.

70
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:12,827
- Yeah, well, its a chunk, but ...
- I had two lots. Lost a lot of money.

71
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:18,290
- Yah, but the difference ...
- Why not show it to Stan Grossman?

72
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:21,084
Stan'll say no dice.
That's why you pay him.

73
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:23,925
I'm askin' you here, Wade.

74
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,711
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

75
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,131
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

76
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:47,528
Where is Pancake's House?

77
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:51,570
- What?
- We stop at Pancake's House.

78
00:08:52,872 --> 00:08:55,114
You nuts? 
We had pancakes for breakfast.

79
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:58,956
I gotta go to a place where I can 
get a shot and a beer and steak.

80
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,369
Not more fucking pancakes. 
Come on.

81
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:08,419
Oh, come on, man.

82
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:11,928
OK, here's an idea.

83
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:15,848
We can stop outside of Brainerd.
I know a place there we can get laid.

84
00:09:15,937 --> 00:09:18,723
- I'm fuckin' hungry now.
- Yeah, yeah. Jesus.

85
00:09:18,815 --> 00:09:23,725
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes
and then we'll get laid. All right?

86
00:09:36,874 --> 00:09:39,827
We sat right here in this room
and went over this.

87
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,998
- Yah, but that TruCoat ...
- I said I didn't want any TruCoat.

88
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:49,794
Yah, but I'm saying, that TruCoat, you
don't get it, you get oxidation problems ...

89
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:54,098
You're sitting there talking in circles
like we didn't go over this already.

90
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:57,349
- Yeah, but this TruCoat ...
- We had a deal for $19,500.

91
00:09:57,436 --> 00:10:02,892
Darned if you didn't tell me you'd get me
this car without the sealant for $19,500.

92
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:06,767
- All right, I'm not saying I didn't.
- You called me and said you had it.

93
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:09,613
"Ready to make delivery" you says.

94
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:13,990
And here you are and you're
wasting my time and my wife's time.

95
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:17,528
And I'm paying $19,500
for this vehicle here.

96
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,662
All right.

97
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,871
I'll talk to my boss.

98
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:28,876
See, they install that TruCoat at the 
factory. There's nothing we can do.

99
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:31,373
But I'll talk to my boss.

100
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:34,168
These guys here. These guys.

101
00:10:35,224 --> 00:10:38,094
Its always the same. 
Its always more.

102
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,266
- You going to the Gophers on Sunday?
- Oh, you betcha.

103
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:47,599
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

104
00:10:48,695 --> 00:10:50,817
You kiddin'?

105
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,904
Well.

106
00:10:56,077 --> 00:11:00,489
He's never done this before, but seein' 
as its special circumstances an' all,

107
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:03,784
he says I can knock 
$100 off that TruCoat.

108
00:11:05,211 --> 00:11:07,119
One hundred?

109
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:11,460
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.
You're a bald-faced liar.

110
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:13,293
Bucky, please.

111
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:15,793
A fucking liar.

112
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:17,547
Bucky, please.

113
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,596
Where's my goddamn chequebook?
Lets get this over with.

114
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,096
Where is it?

115
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,181
From Hollywood,
The "Tonight Show", star ...

116
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:08,101
I am talking about your potential.

117
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:12,057
You're not a "C" student.

118
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:13,479
Yeah.

119
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,025
Yet you're gettin' "C" grades.

120
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:19,067
Its that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.

121
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,068
- You know what a disparity is?
- Yeah!

122
00:12:23,163 --> 00:12:27,374
OK. Well, that's why we don't want 
you goin' out for hockey.

123
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,246
Oh, man! Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour ....

124
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:33,584
Hold on.

125
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,998
- What's the big deal?
- Hello.

126
00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,048
- Yeah, hi, hon.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

127
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:41,670
- Is Jerry around?
- Yah. Hon? Yah, he's here.

128
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:45,347
- I'll catch him for ya. Hon? Its Dad.
- OK.

129
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:47,972
- Look, Dad, there's no fucking way ...
- Scotty!

130
00:12:48,063 --> 00:12:50,932
Hey, lets watch that language there.

131
00:12:51,024 --> 00:12:53,395
- How ya doin' there, Wade?
- What's goin' on?

132
00:12:53,484 --> 00:12:55,856
Nothin', Wade. How ya doin' there?

133
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:59,563
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.
He says its pretty sweet.

134
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:01,945
- No kiddin'?
- Might be interested.

135
00:13:02,034 --> 00:13:07,490
No kiddin'? I'd need the cash pretty quick
there, in order to close the deal.

136
00:13:07,582 --> 00:13:12,492
Come by at 2.30. We'll talk about it. If your
numbers are right, Stan says its sweet.

137
00:13:12,586 --> 00:13:14,459
- Stan, you know, Grossman.
- Yah.

138
00:13:14,546 --> 00:13:16,622
- 2.30.
- Yah. OK.

139
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,311
Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

140
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:37,182
Say, you know those two fellas you
put me in touch with up there in Fargo?

141
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,061
- Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
- Well, he had a buddy there. He ...

142
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:43,278
- I don't vouch for him.
- That's OK.

143
00:13:43,367 --> 00:13:46,901
- I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
- Carl something.

144
00:13:46,995 --> 00:13:49,366
Never heard of him. 
Don't vouch for him.

145
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:53,239
He's a buddy of the guy you 
vouch for, so I'm not worrying.

146
00:13:53,335 --> 00:13:55,493
I gotta get in touch with him.

147
00:13:55,588 --> 00:14:00,794
This deal I needed 'em for, I may not need
it any more. Something's happenin', see.

148
00:14:00,884 --> 00:14:05,011
- Call him up.
- I did, and I haven't been able to get him.

149
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:08,299
So I thought maybe you'd know
an alternate number.

150
00:14:08,392 --> 00:14:10,383
- Nope.
- OK.

151
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,552
Well, real good, then.

152
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,703
Can you crack
a fuckin' window open, man?

153
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:42,753
You know, its proven second-hand smoke
is a carcino ... You know, a cancer agent.

154
00:14:45,303 --> 00:14:49,217
Look at that — Twin Cities.
That's the IDS building, the big glass one.

155
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:54,015
The tallest skyscraper in the Midwest,
after the Sears in Chicago,

156
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:56,973
or John Hancock Building, whatever.

157
00:14:57,065 --> 00:14:59,555
Have you ever been to Minneapolis?

158
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,108
Nope.

159
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:06,488
Would it kill you to say something?

160
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:09,064
- I did.
- "No"?

161
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,610
That's the first thing you've said
in the last four hours.

162
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:18,126
That's a fountain
of conversation, man. That's a geyser.

163
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:21,793
I mean, whoa, daddy. Stand back, man.

164
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,339
Shit.

165
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:29,383
I'm sittin' here drivin' — I'm doin' all the
drivin', whole fuckin' way from Brainerd —

166
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:35,640
just tryin' to chat, you know, keep our
spirits up, fight the boredom of the road,

167
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:40,104
and you can't say one fuckin' thing
just in the way of conversation?

168
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,354
Oh, fuck it. 
I don't have to talk either, man.

169
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,519
See how you like it.

170
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:54,576
Just total fuckin' silence.
Two can play at that game, smart guy.

171
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,738
We'll just see how you like it.

172
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:01,368
Total silence.

173
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:07,799
Mr. Lundegaard, this is Reilly Diefenbach
from GMAC. How are you this morning?

174
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:12,047
- Real good. How you doin'?
- Good. You're hard to get on the phone.

175
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:15,423
Yah, its pretty darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.

176
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:20,558
That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these
last financing documents you sent us,

177
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,722
I can't read the serial numbers.

178
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,726
Yah, but its OK. The loans are in place.
I already got the ... What?

179
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:31,734
- $320,000. You got the money last month.
- Yah. So we're all set, then.

180
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:38,408
Yes, but the vehicles you're borrowing on,
I can't read the serial numbers. If you ...

181
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,281
- But the deal's done. I got the money.
- Yes. We have an audit here.

182
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,540
I just have to know that these vehicles
you're financing with this money exist.

183
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,580
- Yah, well, they exist all right.
- Well, I'm sure they do.

184
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,091
But I can't read the serial numbers,
so if you could read me ...

185
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,597
Yah, but, see ... I don't have 'em in front
of me. Why don't I fax you over a copy?

186
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:04,303
Fax is no good. That's what I have,
and I can't read the darn thing ...

187
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,316
Yah, OK. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

188
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:12,607
OK. Because if I can't correlate this note
with the vehicles, I call back that money.

189
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,403
- Yah. How much money was that?
- $320,000.

190
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,741
I gotta correlate that money
with the cars its being lent on.

191
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,829
- OK. No problem. I'll fax that over ...
- No, no. Fax is ...

192
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,999
- I mean send it. I'll shoot it over to you.
- OK, fine.

193
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:27,160
OK. Real good, then.

194
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:35,300
- We're with Katie Carlson.
- Hi.

195
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,553
Now, we just want to remind
all of our viewers at home ...

196
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,100
that this March, for the second year in
a row, Katie and I, with Twin City Travel,

197
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:45,973
will be leading
a two-week trip down the Nile.

198
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:51,105
Its a terrific time. I know you've heard
about it. We want all of you to come with.

199
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,111
And that's the truth.

200
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:57,566
OK, for those who've just joined us,
Katie is gonna show us ...

201
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,992
how to make Holidazzle eggs at home.

202
00:18:01,078 --> 00:18:03,153
- Now, Katie, I gotta admit.
- What?

203
00:18:03,247 --> 00:18:07,909
I was a little bit surprised when I first
picked this up. This is an empty egg.

204
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,956
- That's right, Dale.
- There was an egg in here, right?

205
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:13,667
- Yeah.
- OK, well, how do you ...

206
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:17,340
You don't have an empty chicken
somewhere that lays empty eggs?

207
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,129
No, no. I guarantee this was
an honest-to-goodness Grade "A" ...

208
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,446
- Unguent.
- What?

209
00:18:38,532 --> 00:18:40,773
I need unguent.

210
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,772
- Am I doin' it?
- Push it.

211
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:27,659
Shit.

212
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:26,757
- How're you, Stan? How ya doin', Wade?
- Good to see you again, Jerry.

213
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:29,516
If the numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

214
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,300
- Oh, those numbers are right, all right.
- This is doable.

215
00:20:33,396 --> 00:20:37,014
- Congratulations, Jer.
- Thanks, Stan. Its a pretty ...

216
00:20:37,108 --> 00:20:40,061
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

217
00:20:42,113 --> 00:20:47,451
The financials are pretty thorough, so
the only thing we don't know is your fee.

218
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:51,532
My fee? Wade, what the heck
are you talkin' about?

219
00:20:51,622 --> 00:20:53,744
- Stan and I are OK.
- Yah.

220
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:56,583
- We're good to load in.
- Yah.

221
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:59,953
But we never talked about your fee
for bringing it to us.

222
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:04,126
No, Wade, I was bringing you this deal
for you to loan me the money to put in.

223
00:21:04,217 --> 00:21:06,293
Its my deal here, see.

224
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:10,426
We thought you were
bringing us an investment.

225
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:15,261
- Yah. Right.
- You're sayin' ... What are you sayin'?

226
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:19,600
You're saying we put in all the money
and you collect when it pays off.

227
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:25,354
No, no, see, but I'd pay you back
the principal, and interest.

228
00:21:25,448 --> 00:21:29,444
- Heck, I'd go one over prime.
- We're not a bank, Jerry.

229
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:34,824
If I wanted bank interest on $750,000, I'd
go to Midwest Federal, talk to Bill Diehl.

230
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:36,574
- He's at Norstar.
- He's at ...

231
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:41,043
No, no. But, see,
I don't need a finder's fee.

232
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:42,788
I need ...

233
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:47,875
Finder's fee's, what, 10%? Heck, that's not
gonna do it for me. I need the principal.

234
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:52,630
- We're not gonna give you $750,000.
- What the heck were you thinking?

235
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:56,638
If I'm only getting bank interest,
I want complete security. Heck, FDIC.

236
00:21:56,728 --> 00:22:00,475
- I don't see nothing like that here.
- Yeah, but I ...

237
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,770
OK. I'd guarantee you your money back.

238
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:09,111
I'm not talking about
your damn word, Jerry.

239
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:12,613
- Jeez, what the heck are you ...
- We're not a bank, Jerry.

240
00:22:12,702 --> 00:22:17,613
Well, look, I don't wanna cut you out
of the loop, but this here's a good deal.

241
00:22:17,707 --> 00:22:22,582
I assume if you're not interested,
you won't mind if we move on it.

242
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,958
Independently.

243
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:26,853
Dammit! Dammit!

244
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,053
Hon?

245
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:02,967
Got the groceries.

246
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:42,091
Yah, Wade, its Jerry.

247
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:44,055
I ...

248
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:48,767
Wade, its Jerry.
I don't know what to do. Its Jean.

249
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,428
I don't know what to do. Its my wife.

250
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,682
I don't know what to do. Its Jean.

251
00:24:55,905 --> 00:24:59,238
Yeah, Wade, its Jerry. I ...

252
00:25:01,409 --> 00:25:07,033
Wade, its Jerry. I ... We gotta talk.
Its somethin' ... Aw, jeez, its terrible.

253
00:25:15,131 --> 00:25:17,207
Yes?

254
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,375
Yeah. Wade Gustafson, please.

255
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:59,875
Shut the fuck up, or I'll throw you
back into the trunk, you know.

256
00:26:00,343 --> 00:26:03,592
Jeez, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

257
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,725
Ah, shit.

258
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:17,600
Oh, the tags.

259
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:26,231
All right, its just the tags.
I never put my tags on the car.

260
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,450
Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

261
00:26:55,647 --> 00:27:00,853
Keep it still back there, lady, or else
we're gonna have to, you know, shoot ya.

262
00:27:08,702 --> 00:27:11,452
Hey, I'll take care of this.

263
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:36,594
How can I help you, Officer?

264
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:51,067
- This a new car, then, sir?
- Certainly is, Officer. Still got that smell.

265
00:27:52,244 --> 00:27:54,781
You're required to display temporary tags,

266
00:27:54,872 --> 00:27:57,577
either in the plate area
or taped to the back window.

267
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:01,035
- Certainly.
- Can I see your licence and registration?

268
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:03,203
Certainly.

269
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:09,919
Yeah, I was gonna tape up the tag,
you know, to be in full compliance,

270
00:28:10,012 --> 00:28:13,178
but it must've ...

271
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:15,341
It must've slipped my mind.

272
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:22,106
So maybe the best thing to do would be
to take care of that right here in Brainerd.

273
00:28:22,191 --> 00:28:26,058
- What's this, sir?
- My licence and registration.

274
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:29,646
Yeah, I wanna be in compliance.

275
00:28:31,867 --> 00:28:36,244
I was just thinking we could take 
care of it right here, in Brainerd.

276
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,954
Put that back in your pocket, please.

277
00:28:45,046 --> 00:28:47,833
And step out of the car, please, sir.

278
00:29:11,697 --> 00:29:13,772
Shut the fuck up!

279
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,881
Whoa.

280
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:36,004
Whoa, daddy.

281
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:40,049
You'll take care of it.

282
00:29:44,271 --> 00:29:46,513
You are smooth smooth, you know.

283
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,273
Oh, daddy.

284
00:29:51,946 --> 00:29:54,151
Just clear him off the road.

285
00:29:55,074 --> 00:29:56,947
Yeah.

286
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:49,878
Oh, jeez.

287
00:33:55,143 --> 00:33:57,219
Hi, its Marge.

288
00:33:58,481 --> 00:34:00,805
Oh, my. Where?

289
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,559
Yah.

290
00:34:03,443 --> 00:34:05,519
Aw, jeez.

291
00:34:06,947 --> 00:34:09,235
OK, there in a jiff.

292
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:11,400
Real good, then.

293
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:18,580
OK.

294
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:22,245
You can sleep. Its early yet.

295
00:34:22,337 --> 00:34:24,412
- Gotta go?
- Yeah.

296
00:34:25,549 --> 00:34:27,873
I'll fix you some eggs.

297
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,043
That's OK, hon. I gotta run.

298
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:32,424
You gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.

299
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:36,425
I'll fix you some eggs.

300
00:34:37,477 --> 00:34:39,552
Oh, hon, you can sleep.

301
00:34:39,646 --> 00:34:41,721
You gotta eat a breakfast.

302
00:34:45,402 --> 00:34:47,608
I'll fix you some eggs.

303
00:34:47,695 --> 00:34:49,770
Ah, Norm.

304
00:34:56,371 --> 00:34:58,991
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.

305
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:01,369
- Love you, Margie.
- Love you, hon.

306
00:35:34,783 --> 00:35:36,859
- Hon.
- Yah?

307
00:35:36,953 --> 00:35:39,359
Prowler needs a jump.

308
00:35:58,391 --> 00:36:00,631
Hiya, Lou.

309
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,595
Whoo! What ya got there?

310
00:36:03,687 --> 00:36:06,438
Margie, thought you might
need a little warm-up.

311
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:08,397
Thanks a bunch.

312
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:11,020
What's the deal?
Gary says triple homicide.

313
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:14,395
Yah. Looks pretty bad.
Two of 'em are over here.

314
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:17,490
- Where is everybody?
- Well ...

315
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:19,863
Its cold, Margie.

316
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:23,492
Watch your step, Margie.

317
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:35,421
Aw, jeez. So ...

318
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,383
Aw, jeez.

319
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,462
Here's the second one!

320
00:36:40,348 --> 00:36:43,218
Its in the head and the hand there.

321
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:47,935
- I guess that's a defensive wound.
- Oh, yah?

322
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:51,098
Where's the state trooper?

323
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:55,141
Back there a good piece,
in the ditch next to his prowler.

324
00:36:55,238 --> 00:36:57,111
OK.

325
00:36:57,198 --> 00:37:02,986
So we got a trooper pulls someone over,
we got a shooting, these folks drive by,

326
00:37:03,078 --> 00:37:07,823
there's a high-speed pursuit, ends here,
and then this execution-type deal.

327
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,458
Yah.

328
00:37:10,503 --> 00:37:13,538
I'd be very surprised
if our suspect was from Brainerd.

329
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,088
Yah.

330
00:37:16,426 --> 00:37:20,837
And I'll tell you what. From his 
footprint, he looks like a big fella.

331
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:27,471
You see something down there, Chief?

332
00:37:27,562 --> 00:37:30,597
No, I just think I'm gonna barf.

333
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:32,764
Jeez.

334
00:37:32,858 --> 00:37:35,859
- You OK, Margie?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

335
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:40,527
Its just morning sickness.

336
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:45,232
- Well, that passed.
- Yah?

337
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,736
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.

338
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:49,822
You had breakfast yet, Margie?

339
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,789
Oh, yah.

340
00:37:51,877 --> 00:37:54,164
- Norm made some eggs.
- Yah?

341
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,502
Well ...

342
00:37:57,591 --> 00:37:59,915
What now, do you think?

343
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,966
Lets go take a look at that trooper.

344
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:07,588
- There's different footprints here, Lou.
- Yah?

345
00:38:07,684 --> 00:38:11,432
- Yah. This guy's smaller than his buddy.
- Oh, yah?

346
00:38:12,689 --> 00:38:15,856
- For Pete's sake.
- How's it look, Marge?

347
00:38:15,942 --> 00:38:21,861
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there,
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

348
00:38:21,948 --> 00:38:24,652
- Its a real shame.
- Yah.

349
00:38:27,913 --> 00:38:30,996
- Didn't monkey with his car there, did ya?
- No way.

350
00:38:31,082 --> 00:38:35,412
Somebody shut his lights. Guess the little
guy sat in there waiting for his buddy.

351
00:38:35,503 --> 00:38:38,207
- Yah. Would've been cold out here.
- Heck, yah.

352
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:41,002
- Ya think, is Dave open yet?
- Dave?

353
00:38:42,135 --> 00:38:44,008
You think he's mixed up in this?

354
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:47,179
Oh, no. I just wanna get Norm
some night crawlers.

355
00:38:50,018 --> 00:38:53,018
- Did you look in his citation book?
- Yah.

356
00:38:53,103 --> 00:38:59,557
Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at
2:18 AM. Under plate number he put DLR.

357
00:38:59,652 --> 00:39:03,779
I figure they shot him before he could 
finish filling out the tag number.

358
00:39:04,615 --> 00:39:08,066
So I got the state looking for 
a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.

359
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:11,114
They don't got no match yet.

360
00:39:11,205 --> 00:39:15,285
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%
on your police work there, Lou.

361
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:17,249
- Yah?
- Yah.

362
00:39:17,337 --> 00:39:22,674
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates. DLR.

363
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:29,429
Jeez.

364
00:39:30,474 --> 00:39:34,850
Lou, d'you hear the one about the guy
who couldn't afford personalised plates,

365
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:38,602
so he went and
changed his name to J3L2404?

366
00:39:39,232 --> 00:39:41,520
Yah, that's a good one.

367
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:52,364
Look, all's I know is you got
a problem, you call a professional.

368
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:57,994
No. They said no cops. They said
"You call your cops, we're gonna shoot ..."

369
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:01,832
Of course they'll say that.
Where's my protection? They got Jean.

370
00:40:01,922 --> 00:40:05,622
If I give 'em a million,
where's my guarantee they'll let her go?

371
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:08,421
- Well, they ...
- A million dollars is a lot of money.

372
00:40:08,512 --> 00:40:11,215
- They got my daughter.
- Think this thing through.

373
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:14,223
You give 'em what they want,
why won't they let her go?

374
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:17,344
You gotta listen to me 
on this one, Wade.

375
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:21,101
Heck, you don't know.
You're just whistling Dixie here.

376
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:24,475
The cops can advise us on this.
I'm saying call a professional.

377
00:40:24,568 --> 00:40:26,644
No. No cops!

378
00:40:27,614 --> 00:40:30,234
That's final. 
This is my deal here, Wade.

379
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:33,325
- Yeah ...
- Jean is my wife here.

380
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:36,577
I gotta tell you, Wade,
I'm leaning to Jerry's viewpoint.

381
00:40:36,665 --> 00:40:39,665
- Well ...
- We gotta protect Jean. These ...

382
00:40:39,751 --> 00:40:43,415
We're not holding any cards. They 
got 'em all, so they call the shots.

383
00:40:43,504 --> 00:40:45,792
- You're darned tootin'.
- Oh, dammit.

384
00:40:45,882 --> 00:40:49,416
- I'm tellin' ya.
- Well, why don't we ...

385
00:40:50,344 --> 00:40:53,213
Stan, I'm thinking
we should offer 'em half a million.

386
00:40:53,305 --> 00:40:56,840
Now, come on here!
No way, Wade. No way.

387
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:59,341
- We're not horse-tradin' here, Wade.
- Yeah.

388
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:02,769
- We gotta just bite the bullet on this thing.
- Yeah.

389
00:41:04,274 --> 00:41:07,026
So what's the next step here, Jerry?

390
00:41:07,112 --> 00:41:11,607
They're gonna call me with instructions
for a drop. I need the money by tomorrow.

391
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:13,571
Dammit!

392
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:18,619
- How was everything today?
- Yah. Real good now.

393
00:41:20,749 --> 00:41:22,907
How you doin'?

394
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:28,458
OK. Now, we'll get the money together.
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

395
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:32,130
Now, do you want anyone at home
with you till they call?

396
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:37,047
No, I ... They were just supposed to be
dealing with me. They were real clear.

397
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:41,054
You know, they said no one listening in.
They'll be watchin', you know.

398
00:41:41,145 --> 00:41:45,273
Maybe its all bull, but, like you said,
Stan, they're callin' the shots.

399
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,521
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

400
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,770
Yah. Jeez, Scotty.

401
00:41:53,864 --> 00:41:56,402
Yah. I'll go talk to him.

402
00:42:11,465 --> 00:42:13,836
How ya doin' there, Scotty?

403
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:16,049
Dad.

404
00:42:16,138 --> 00:42:18,462
What are they doin'?

405
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:22,090
- What do you think they're doin' to Mom?
- Its OK, Scotty.

406
00:42:22,184 --> 00:42:27,012
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.
These men, they just want money.

407
00:42:27,357 --> 00:42:33,110
- What if something goes wrong, Dad?
- No, no, no. Nothing's going wrong here.

408
00:42:33,195 --> 00:42:38,153
Grand-dad and I, we're making sure
this gets handled right.

409
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:41,941
- I really think we should call the cops.
- No, no.

410
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:46,284
No one can know about this thing.
We gotta play ball with these guys.

411
00:42:46,376 --> 00:42:49,411
- Stan Grossman'll tell ya the same thing.
- But, Dad ...

412
00:42:49,503 --> 00:42:54,045
We're gonna get Mom back for ya,
but we gotta play ball, you know.

413
00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:58,464
That's the deal here.

414
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,933
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

415
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:08,601
you just say Mom's down in Florida
with Pearl and Marty.

416
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:14,856
That's the best we can do here.

417
00:43:58,822 --> 00:44:00,613
No!

418
00:44:17,924 --> 00:44:19,582
Whoops!

419
00:44:42,615 --> 00:44:44,690
Thanks, Myra.

420
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:48,276
- Mornin'.
- Carol.

421
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:51,454
Oh, Janie, two more
of those Skin-So-Softs, please.

422
00:44:52,917 --> 00:44:57,164
- Hiya, hon.
- I brought you some lunch, Margie.

423
00:44:57,254 --> 00:44:59,661
- What are those, night crawlers?
- Yah.

424
00:44:59,757 --> 00:45:02,959
- Aw, thanks, hon.
- You bet. Thanks for lunch.

425
00:45:03,051 --> 00:45:05,672
Oh, yah, looks pretty good.

426
00:45:05,763 --> 00:45:08,467
What have we got here? Arby's?

427
00:45:08,557 --> 00:45:11,226
- How's the paintin' goin'?
- Pretty good.

428
00:45:12,268 --> 00:45:17,144
- The Hautmans are entering a painting.
- Aw, hon, you're better than them.

429
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:21,443
- They're real good.
- They're good, Norm. But you're better.

430
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:26,233
You think so?

431
00:45:26,325 --> 00:45:28,400
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

432
00:45:30,954 --> 00:45:34,571
- Hey, Norm. How's the paintin' goin'?
- Not too bad, you know.

433
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:38,959
- How we doin' on that vehicle?
- No motels registered a Ciera last night.

434
00:45:39,046 --> 00:45:42,248
But the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox ...

435
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,625
registering a Ciera
and leaving the tag space blank.

436
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:47,925
- Jeez, that's a good lead.
- Yah.

437
00:45:48,013 --> 00:45:51,132
- That's that truckers' joint on I-35?
- Yah.

438
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,967
Owner was on the desk then.
Said these two had company.

439
00:45:55,437 --> 00:45:58,010
- Oh, yah?
- Yah.

440
00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:05,821
- We both did. She went to college, too.
- I went to Normandale for about a year.

441
00:46:05,906 --> 00:46:08,194
- Yah, that's where we met.
- I dropped out.

442
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:10,689
- Yah, she dropped.
- Yah.

443
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:13,191
- So where are you girls from?
- Chaska.

444
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:18,033
Le Sueur, but I went to high school
in White Bear Lake. Go, Bears.

445
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:22,367
OK. I want you to tell me
what these fellas look like.

446
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,499
- The little guy was kinda funny-lookin'.
- In what way?

447
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:29,540
- I don't know. Just funny-lookin'.
- Can you be any more specific?

448
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:33,007
I couldn't really say.
He wasn't circumcised.

449
00:46:34,266 --> 00:46:38,346
- Was he funny-lookin' apart from that?
- Yah.

450
00:46:39,188 --> 00:46:42,852
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then?

451
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:47,356
- Anything else you can say about him?
- No.

452
00:46:47,446 --> 00:46:51,657
Like I say, he was funny-lookin'.
More than most people, even.

453
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:54,196
- What about the other fella?
- He was older.

454
00:46:54,285 --> 00:46:56,859
- He looked like the Marlboro Man.
- Oh, yah?

455
00:46:56,956 --> 00:47:01,866
Yah. But maybe I'm saying that
cos he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

456
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,792
- Like a subconscious type of thing.
- Oh, yah, that can happen.

457
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,715
- Hey, they were goin' to the Twin Cities.
- Oh, yah?

458
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:11,089
Yah. Yah. Is that useful to ya?

459
00:47:11,177 --> 00:47:12,836
Oh, you betcha, yah.

460
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:15,004
Yah.

461
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,932
Come on! Goddammit!

462
00:47:22,355 --> 00:47:24,643
Jesus Christ.

463
00:47:24,732 --> 00:47:27,650
Come on, you fucking shit box.

464
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:31,274
Been here for days.

465
00:47:31,364 --> 00:47:33,735
Goddammit, nothin' to do.

466
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:37,448
Fucking TV doesn't even ...

467
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:42,869
Dammit, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

468
00:47:44,878 --> 00:47:46,954
Goddammit!

469
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,164
Unbelievable. Come on.

470
00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:53,132
God ...

471
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:54,463
Fuck!

472
00:47:54,554 --> 00:47:57,887
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby.
Come on.

473
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:01,342
Come on!

474
00:48:02,353 --> 00:48:04,926
Fuck. Fuck.

475
00:48:05,022 --> 00:48:06,813
Fuck! Fuck!

476
00:48:13,321 --> 00:48:17,948
The bark beetle
carries the worm to its nest,

477
00:48:18,036 --> 00:48:21,569
where it will feed its young
for up to six months.

478
00:48:23,915 --> 00:48:27,201
In the spring, the larvae hatch
and the cycle begins again.

479
00:48:27,295 --> 00:48:29,749
Well.

480
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,080
I'm turning in, Norm.

481
00:48:32,174 --> 00:48:34,249
Oh, yeah?

482
00:48:36,429 --> 00:48:39,097
Here it is throwing off 
the larval envelope.

483
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:56,063
- Hello.
- Yah, is this Marge?

484
00:48:56,157 --> 00:48:58,647
- Yah.
- Margie Olmstead?

485
00:49:00,035 --> 00:49:02,192
Yah. Who's this?

486
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:04,492
This is Mike Yanagita!

487
00:49:04,581 --> 00:49:07,072
You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?

488
00:49:09,669 --> 00:49:11,328
Mike Yanagita?

489
00:49:11,421 --> 00:49:13,080
Yah!

490
00:49:13,173 --> 00:49:15,877
Well, yah.

491
00:49:15,968 --> 00:49:19,051
Course I remember you.
How are ya doin'?

492
00:49:19,137 --> 00:49:22,920
- What time is it?
- Oh, jeez, its a quarter to eleven.

493
00:49:23,016 --> 00:49:26,883
- I hope I didn't wake you.
- No. That's OK.

494
00:49:26,978 --> 00:49:29,433
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities.

495
00:49:29,522 --> 00:49:32,439
I was watching on TV
about these shootings in Brainerd,

496
00:49:32,525 --> 00:49:34,398
- and I saw you on the news.
- Yah.

497
00:49:34,486 --> 00:49:37,855
I thought "Jeez, is that Margie Olmstead?
I can't believe it."

498
00:49:37,947 --> 00:49:40,900
Yah. That's me.

499
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:42,651
Well, how the heck are ya?

500
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:45,864
OK, you know. OK.

501
00:49:45,955 --> 00:49:48,196
- Yah?
- Yah.

502
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:51,207
- How are you doin'?
- Oh, pretty good.

503
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,548
Aw, heck.
Its been such a long time, Mike.

504
00:49:57,592 --> 00:49:59,667
Its great to hear from ya.

505
00:50:02,763 --> 00:50:08,005
Yah, you got your ... This is loaded
here. This has your independent ...

506
00:50:08,102 --> 00:50:11,221
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

507
00:50:11,313 --> 00:50:14,562
antilock brakes, alarm, radar.

508
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,354
And I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

509
00:50:17,445 --> 00:50:21,572
- This TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off.
- I don't need no sealant.

510
00:50:21,657 --> 00:50:23,529
Yah, you don't need that.

511
00:50:23,617 --> 00:50:28,955
Were you thinking of financing here?
You aware of this GMAC plan? Its super.

512
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,744
- Got a call for you, Jerry.
- Yah, OK.

513
00:50:38,757 --> 00:50:42,291
- Jerry Lundegaard.
- Jerry, got the phone to yourself?

514
00:50:42,386 --> 00:50:44,507
- Well, yah.
- You know who this is?

515
00:50:44,596 --> 00:50:48,428
Well, yah. I got an idea.
How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?

516
00:50:48,517 --> 00:50:50,841
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

517
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:53,770
Well, what do you mean?

518
00:50:53,855 --> 00:50:58,517
Things have changed. Circumstances
beyond the ... Acts of God, force majeure.

519
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,898
What the ... How's Jean?

520
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:05,693
- Who's Jean?
- My wife. What the ...

521
00:51:05,784 --> 00:51:09,365
She's all right, but there's three 
people in Brainerd who aren't OK.

522
00:51:09,454 --> 00:51:12,407
What are you talking about?
Lets finish this deal here.

523
00:51:12,499 --> 00:51:15,369
Blood has been shed, Jerry.

524
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,579
- What the heck do you mean?
- Three people in Brainerd.

525
00:51:18,672 --> 00:51:21,874
- Oh, jeez.
- That's right. And we need more money.

526
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:25,132
What are you talkin' about?
What have you got mixed up in?

527
00:51:25,219 --> 00:51:28,385
- We need more money ...
- This was a no-rough-stuff deal.

528
00:51:28,473 --> 00:51:33,015
- Don't interrupt me. Shut the fuck up!
- Well, I'm sorry, but I just ...

529
00:51:33,102 --> 00:51:37,051
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
We now want the entire $80,000.

530
00:51:37,148 --> 00:51:41,560
- Oh, for Chrissake here.
- Blood's been shed. We've incurred risks.

531
00:51:41,653 --> 00:51:44,024
I'm coming to town tomorrow
for the money.

532
00:51:44,113 --> 00:51:46,568
Now, we had a deal here. 
A deal's a deal.

533
00:51:46,658 --> 00:51:51,200
Is it, Jerry? Ask those three poor souls
up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal. Ask 'em!

534
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:54,785
- The heck do you mean?
- "Heck d'you mean?" See you tomorrow.

535
00:51:59,045 --> 00:52:01,120
- Yah.
- Jerome Lundegaard?

536
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:04,213
- Yah.
- This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.

537
00:52:04,299 --> 00:52:07,004
Sir, I've not received those vehicle IDs.

538
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:10,011
Yah. I ... Those are in the mail.

539
00:52:10,097 --> 00:52:15,471
That may be. However, absent the receipt
of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon,

540
00:52:15,562 --> 00:52:18,396
I'll have to refer this matter
to our legal department.

541
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,555
- Yah.
- My patience is at an end.

542
00:52:20,649 --> 00:52:22,107
- Yah.
- Good day, sir.

543
00:52:22,192 --> 00:52:24,065
Yah.

544
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,744
Hi, Norm. How ya doin', Margie?

545
00:53:24,837 --> 00:53:27,838
- How's the fricassee?
- Pretty darn good. You want some?

546
00:53:27,924 --> 00:53:32,301
Oh, no. I got ... Hey, Norm. I thought
you was goin' ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

547
00:53:33,888 --> 00:53:36,176
- Yah. After lunch.
- Ah.

548
00:53:36,266 --> 00:53:39,764
- What you got there?
- Oh. The numbers you asked for.

549
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:44,762
Calls made from the lobby phone at the
Blue Ox. Two to Minneapolis that night.

550
00:53:44,857 --> 00:53:49,684
First one's a trucking company, second's
a private residence. A Shep Proudfoot.

551
00:53:49,778 --> 00:53:51,936
A what?

552
00:53:52,031 --> 00:53:54,485
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.

553
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:00,193
OK. Yah.

554
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:04,416
- Think I'll take a drive down there, then.
- Oh, yah? Twin Cities?

555
00:54:07,046 --> 00:54:09,452
Oh, yah?

556
00:54:22,394 --> 00:54:25,264
Dammit, I wanna be a part of this thing.

557
00:54:25,355 --> 00:54:29,566
No. Wade, they were clear. They said
they'd call tomorrow with instructions,

558
00:54:29,651 --> 00:54:34,229
- and its gotta be delivered by me alone.
- Its my money. I'll deliver it.

559
00:54:34,322 --> 00:54:36,943
- What do they care?
- Wade's got a point there.

560
00:54:37,034 --> 00:54:42,323
- I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
- No, no. See, they only deal with me.

561
00:54:42,414 --> 00:54:46,032
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

562
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:48,794
They're very ... These guys are dangerous.

563
00:54:48,879 --> 00:54:51,333
All the more reason. I don't want you ...

564
00:54:51,423 --> 00:54:54,423
With all due respect,
I don't want you mucking this up.

565
00:54:54,508 --> 00:54:57,130
- What?
- They want my money, they deal with me,

566
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,635
or I go to a professional.
There's a million dollars here!

567
00:55:00,724 --> 00:55:04,388
- No, see ...
- Jerry, you're not selling me a damn car!

568
00:55:04,477 --> 00:55:06,932
Its my show here. That's that.

569
00:55:08,565 --> 00:55:11,898
Its the way we prefer to handle it, Jerry.

570
00:55:17,574 --> 00:55:19,649
Hi. How ya doin'?

571
00:55:19,742 --> 00:55:23,904
- Real good. How you doin' today, ma'am?
- I'm doing really super there, thanks.

572
00:55:23,996 --> 00:55:26,665
I'm Mrs. Gunderson. I have a reservation.

573
00:55:27,876 --> 00:55:30,544
Yup, you sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

574
00:55:30,628 --> 00:55:33,414
Is there a phone down here, ya think?

575
00:55:35,342 --> 00:55:37,001
Detective Sibert?

576
00:55:37,094 --> 00:55:41,470
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

577
00:55:41,555 --> 00:55:45,968
Yeah, well, actually I'm in town here.
I had to do a few things in the Twin Cities,

578
00:55:46,061 --> 00:55:50,805
so I thought I'd check in with ya about
that USFI search on Shep Proudfoot.

579
00:55:52,024 --> 00:55:54,146
Oh, yah?

580
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:57,271
Well, maybe I'll go visit
with him if I have a ...

581
00:55:57,363 --> 00:56:00,279
No, I can find that.

582
00:56:00,366 --> 00:56:03,319
Yah, well, thanks a bunch. 
Oh, say, say.

583
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:08,156
Would you happen to know a good place
for lunch in the downtown area?

584
00:56:08,248 --> 00:56:10,536
The Radisson.

585
00:56:10,626 --> 00:56:13,032
Oh, yah. Is it reasonable?

586
00:57:30,162 --> 00:57:33,862
- Hi. How ya doin'?
- Yeah. I decided not to park here.

587
00:57:34,959 --> 00:57:37,284
What? You decided not to park here?

588
00:57:37,378 --> 00:57:40,164
Yeah, I just came in.
I decided not to park here, so ...

589
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,710
But ... Well, I'm sorry, sir ...

590
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,967
Yeah, I decided not to ... I ...

591
00:57:46,053 --> 00:57:49,302
I'm not ... I decided not
to take the trip, as it turns out.

592
00:57:49,765 --> 00:57:53,513
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
We've still gotta charge you the $4.

593
00:57:54,811 --> 00:57:57,563
I just pulled in here.
I just fucking pulled in here.

594
00:57:57,648 --> 00:58:01,312
Well, but, see,
there's a minimum charge of $4.

595
00:58:01,402 --> 00:58:04,188
Long-term parking charges by the day.

596
00:58:08,826 --> 00:58:13,819
I guess you think you're like an authority
figure, with that stupid fucking uniform?

597
00:58:14,747 --> 00:58:17,997
Fucking clip-on tie there.
Big fucking man, huh?

598
00:58:18,085 --> 00:58:21,833
These are the limits of your life.
Ruler of your little fucking gate.

599
00:58:21,921 --> 00:58:25,040
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

600
00:58:27,261 --> 00:58:30,676
- Where's Shep?
- Talking to a cop.

601
00:58:30,763 --> 00:58:34,048
- Cop?
- Said she was a cop.

602
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:39,474
Do you remember getting a call
Wednesday night?

603
00:58:39,564 --> 00:58:40,808
Nope.

604
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:45,484
- You reside at 1425 Freemont Terrace?
- Yup.

605
00:58:45,571 --> 00:58:48,690
- Anyone else residing there?
- No.

606
00:58:48,781 --> 00:58:52,992
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past three in the morning.

607
00:58:53,077 --> 00:58:57,573
Its just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

608
00:58:57,665 --> 00:58:59,822
Now, I know you've had some problems.

609
00:58:59,917 --> 00:59:04,993
Struggling with the narcotics, some
other entanglements, currently on parole.

610
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:08,044
- So?
- Well, associating with criminals,

611
00:59:08,134 --> 00:59:12,594
if you're the one they talked to, that right
there would be a violation of your parole.

612
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,515
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

613
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,181
I saw some rough stuff on your priors,
but nothing like a homicide.

614
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:23,219
I know you don't wanna be
an accessory to something like that.

615
00:59:25,275 --> 00:59:29,688
So, you think you might remember
who those folks were who called ya?

616
00:59:37,955 --> 00:59:40,279
- Mr. Lundegaard?
- Yeah.

617
00:59:40,374 --> 00:59:44,371
- Could I take a minute of your time here?
- What is it all about?

618
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:47,794
D'you mind if I sit down?
Carrying quite a load here.

619
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:52,752
- You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
- No, I ... Executive sales manager.

620
00:59:52,844 --> 00:59:56,889
- You can help me. I'm Marge Gunderson.
- My father-in-law is the owner.

621
00:59:56,974 --> 01:00:02,015
Well, I'm a police officer from up
Brainerd investigating some malfeasance.

622
01:00:02,103 --> 01:00:07,524
I was wondering if you'd had any vehicles
stolen off the lot in the past two weeks.

623
01:00:08,819 --> 01:00:11,309
Specifically, a tan-coloured Ciera.

624
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,450
Mr. Lundegaard?

625
01:00:19,954 --> 01:00:21,946
Brainerd?

626
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,705
Yah, yah. Home of Paul Bunyan,
Babe the Blue Ox.

627
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,995
Babe the Blue Ox.

628
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:35,001
Yeah, you know,
we got that big statue up there.

629
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:40,927
So, you haven't had any vehicles
go missing, then?

630
01:00:41,017 --> 01:00:42,676
No. No, ma'am.

631
01:00:43,603 --> 01:00:48,348
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let 
you get back to your paperwork, then.

632
01:01:02,205 --> 01:01:04,777
- Yah, get me Shep.
- He's not here right now.

633
01:01:04,873 --> 01:01:07,245
- What the heck d'you mean?
- He stepped out.

634
01:01:07,335 --> 01:01:09,208
- Where did he go?
- I'll get Arty.

635
01:01:09,295 --> 01:01:12,628
No, I don't need a mechanic.
I need a ...

636
01:01:14,966 --> 01:01:18,964
Aw, jeez. 
I gotta talk to a friend of his.

637
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:23,098
So have him ...

638
01:01:24,851 --> 01:01:26,927
- What?
- Aw, jeez.

639
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,499
Mike?

640
01:01:49,584 --> 01:01:51,457
Marge?

641
01:01:52,587 --> 01:01:54,045
Jeez!

642
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,253
- Oh, you look great.
- Yeah, so do you.

643
01:01:56,342 --> 01:01:59,876
Oh, easy there, easy there.
Easy there, easy there.

644
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,257
You do, too. I'm expecting.

645
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:05,015
Oh, I see that. That's great.

646
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,516
- Oh, what can I get ya?
- Oh, just a Diet Coke, please.

647
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:10,844
- OK.
- Great.

648
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:13,014
- This is a nice place.
- Yah.

649
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:17,236
You know, its a Radisson,
so its pretty good. Yah.

650
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,241
So ...

651
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:27,240
- You're living in Edina, then?
- Yah, yah, yah. A couple of years now.

652
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:30,663
Its actually Eden Prairie,
that school district.

653
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:33,786
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

654
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:36,369
So, you married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

655
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:40,081
- Oh, yah. Long time ago.
- Great. Great.

656
01:02:40,176 --> 01:02:42,962
So, what brings you down ...

657
01:02:43,054 --> 01:02:47,182
Are you down here on that homicide,
if you're allowed to discuss that?

658
01:02:47,267 --> 01:02:51,180
Oh, yah, yah. But there's not
a heck of a lot to discuss.

659
01:02:53,897 --> 01:02:57,729
Well, what about you, Mike?
Are you married? You got kids?

660
01:02:57,819 --> 01:03:00,225
Yah, yah. Well ...

661
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:02,894
I was married. I was married to ...

662
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:05,277
You mind if I sit over here?

663
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:10,076
- I was married to Linda Cooksey.
- No, why not sit over there? I prefer that.

664
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:20,125
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, no. Just so I can see ya.

665
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:24,793
- Don't have to turn my neck.
- Oh, sure, sure. I understand.

666
01:03:24,886 --> 01:03:28,006
- I didn't mean to ...
- No, no.

667
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:30,174
That's fine.

668
01:03:31,727 --> 01:03:34,299
Yah. Sorry. Sorry.

669
01:03:35,063 --> 01:03:40,603
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey. You
remember her. She was a year behind us.

670
01:03:40,694 --> 01:03:44,737
Yeah, I think I remember her.
Yeah. She ... Oh, yeah, yeah.

671
01:03:44,823 --> 01:03:46,483
So it didn't work out, huh?

672
01:03:46,576 --> 01:03:50,323
And then I've been working
for Honeywell for a few years now.

673
01:03:50,412 --> 01:03:55,369
- Oh, well, they're a good outfit.
- If you're an engineer, you can do worse.

674
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:59,124
But its not ...
Its nothing like your achievement.

675
01:03:59,462 --> 01:04:02,498
Oh, well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

676
01:04:02,591 --> 01:04:05,710
Its not that things didn't work out.

677
01:04:05,802 --> 01:04:07,877
Its ...

678
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:12,131
Linda had leukaemia, you know.

679
01:04:12,225 --> 01:04:14,383
She was a ... She passed away.

680
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,136
No!

681
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,143
- It was tough.
- There you go.

682
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:24,269
It was long ...

683
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:27,315
She fought real hard, Marge.

684
01:04:30,201 --> 01:04:32,489
What can you say?

685
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:36,988
Oh. Better times, huh?

686
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:39,490
Better times.

687
01:04:41,046 --> 01:04:43,582
Oh, and then I saw ya on the TV ...

688
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:47,290
and I remembered, you know,
I always liked you.

689
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:52,132
- Well, I always liked you, Mike.
- I always liked you so much.

690
01:04:55,309 --> 01:04:57,978
So, Mike, should we
get together another time?

691
01:04:58,062 --> 01:05:00,517
No! I ... I ...

692
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,437
I'm sorry. Its ...

693
01:05:06,529 --> 01:05:10,396
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't have done this. I shouldn't.

694
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:13,858
- I thought we'd have a really terrific time.
- Its OK, Mike.

695
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,657
You were such a super lady.

696
01:05:16,748 --> 01:05:19,664
And then ... I've been so lonely.

697
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:25,078
Its OK, Mike.

698
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:34,717
Here's a song I dedicate
to all the ladies out here tonight.

699
01:05:35,433 --> 01:05:37,555
It goes like this.

700
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:52,688
So, are you from around here?

701
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,322
Just in town on business.

702
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,486
Just in and out.

703
01:06:00,165 --> 01:06:02,489
Just a little of the old "in and out".

704
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:05,910
What do you do?

705
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:15,592
Have you been to the Celebrity Room
before with other clients?

706
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,680
I don't think so. Its nice.

707
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:21,304
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist.

708
01:06:21,393 --> 01:06:24,975
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

709
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:27,306
Waiter.

710
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:30,767
Is he deaf?

711
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:35,606
So, how long you work for
the escort service?

712
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,775
I don't know. A few months.

713
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,153
Find that work interesting, do you?

714
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:44,619
What are you talkin' about?

715
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:46,333
All right.

716
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,088
Come on. I'm hearing bells.

717
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:51,412
Come on, huh?

718
01:06:51,507 --> 01:06:54,127
All right. Where were ya?

719
01:06:58,305 --> 01:07:02,218
Shep, what the hell you doin'?
I'm bangin' that girl. Ow!

720
01:07:02,309 --> 01:07:06,389
Fucking asshole! Get the fuck outta here!

721
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:12,019
Put me back in Stillwater, you little
fucking shithead. Get the fuck outta here!

722
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:16,819
Yo! Cut that shit out, man. I'm trying
to get some goddamn sleep here.

723
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,696
- Come on, brother.
- Fuck you.

724
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,621
- Fuck you.
- Animals!

725
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:32,374
- Animals! Animals!
- Stay away from me, man.

726
01:07:32,464 --> 01:07:36,378
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!
Wait! Don't you dare fucking hit me!

727
01:07:43,766 --> 01:07:47,265
- Fucking little weasel. Fuck you, man.
- Stop it!

728
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:51,220
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

729
01:07:51,316 --> 01:07:55,444
Jesus Christ!
You fucking shitbag motherfucker!

730
01:07:58,865 --> 01:08:01,355
- Yah?
- Jerry, I'm through fucking around.

731
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:04,652
- You got the fucking money?
- Yah, I got the money, but ...

732
01:08:04,745 --> 01:08:10,119
Don't you fucking "but" me! Meet me
at the Radisson parking ramp, 30 minutes,

733
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:12,781
- and we wrap this thing up.
- OK, but ...

734
01:08:12,878 --> 01:08:17,624
You're there in 30 minutes or I shoot you,
your fucking wife and all your children.

735
01:08:17,718 --> 01:08:19,923
And I shoot 'em in the 
back of their heads.

736
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:23,046
- OK, you stay away from Scotty now.
- Got it?

737
01:08:23,139 --> 01:08:25,214
OK. Real good, then.

738
01:08:49,832 --> 01:08:51,574
Dad?

739
01:08:51,667 --> 01:08:54,157
- Its OK, Scotty.
- Where you goin'?

740
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:57,417
I'll be back in a minute.

741
01:08:57,506 --> 01:09:01,669
If Stan calls, you just tell him
I went to Embers.

742
01:09:04,054 --> 01:09:07,139
OK. Here's your damn money.

743
01:09:08,892 --> 01:09:11,133
Now where's my daughter?

744
01:09:11,228 --> 01:09:12,686
You ...

745
01:09:12,771 --> 01:09:16,187
You goddamn punk!

746
01:09:32,123 --> 01:09:34,198
Who the fuck are you?

747
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:38,329
Who the fuck are you?

748
01:09:38,422 --> 01:09:41,126
I've got your damn money.
Where's my daughter?

749
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:46,085
I am through fucking around.
Drop that fucking briefcase!

750
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,963
- Where's my daughter?
- Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry?

751
01:09:50,057 --> 01:09:52,382
I gave simple fucking instructions!

752
01:09:52,685 --> 01:09:55,721
Where's my damn daughter?
No Jean, no money.

753
01:09:55,814 --> 01:09:59,514
- Drop that fucking money!
- No Jean, no money!

754
01:10:01,152 --> 01:10:03,227
Is this a fucking joke here?

755
01:10:12,038 --> 01:10:13,365
Jeez.

756
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:16,990
You happy now, asshole?
What's with you people?

757
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:19,326
You fucking imbeciles.

758
01:10:27,094 --> 01:10:29,169
You fucking shot me!

759
01:11:46,173 --> 01:11:48,129
May I have your ticket, please?

760
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:50,540
Open the fucking gate!

761
01:12:29,715 --> 01:12:31,790
Oh, jeez.

762
01:13:01,496 --> 01:13:03,820
- Dad?
- Yah?

763
01:13:03,915 --> 01:13:05,991
Stan Grossman called.

764
01:13:06,085 --> 01:13:08,409
- Yeah, OK.
- Twice.

765
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,549
Is everything OK?

766
01:13:13,633 --> 01:13:15,091
Yah.

767
01:13:16,762 --> 01:13:18,837
Are you callin' Stan?

768
01:13:20,473 --> 01:13:22,548
Well, I'm ...

769
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:25,932
I'm going to bed now.

770
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:04,715
- How ya doin'?
- Mr. Mohra?

771
01:14:04,808 --> 01:14:06,682
- Yah.
- Officer Olson.

772
01:14:06,769 --> 01:14:09,176
Yah. Righto.

773
01:14:09,272 --> 01:14:13,518
Well, so I'm tendin' bar down there
at Ecklund and Swedlin's last Tuesday.

774
01:14:13,608 --> 01:14:17,523
This little guy's drinkin' and he says
"Where can a guy find some action?"

775
01:14:17,613 --> 01:14:20,020
"I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake."

776
01:14:20,116 --> 01:14:23,733
I says "What kind of action?" He says
"Woman action. What do I look like?"

777
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:27,575
And I says "What do I look like?
I don't arrange that kind of thing."

778
01:14:27,665 --> 01:14:33,334
He says "I'm goin' crazy at the lake." And
I says "But this ain't that kind of place."

779
01:14:33,420 --> 01:14:37,038
He says "Oh, I get it.
So you think I'm a jerk for askin'?"

780
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:40,335
Only he don't use the word "jerk".
Then he calls me a jerk.

781
01:14:40,427 --> 01:14:44,673
Says the last guy who thought he was
a jerk is dead now, so I don't say nothin'.

782
01:14:44,764 --> 01:14:50,185
He says "What d'you think of that?" I says
"Don't sound like a good deal for him."

783
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:54,563
- You got that right!
- Says "Guy's dead, and not of old age."

784
01:14:54,649 --> 01:14:58,065
Then he says "Jeez,
I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake."

785
01:14:58,153 --> 01:14:59,480
White Bear Lake?

786
01:14:59,571 --> 01:15:03,983
Ecklund and Swedlin's closer to
Moose Lake, so I made that assumption.

787
01:15:04,075 --> 01:15:07,740
Anyway, he's drinkin' at the bar,
so I don't think a great deal of it.

788
01:15:07,829 --> 01:15:12,739
But Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides
down here and thought I should call it in,

789
01:15:12,834 --> 01:15:15,324
so I called it in.

790
01:15:17,255 --> 01:15:19,377
End of story.

791
01:15:19,466 --> 01:15:25,254
- What did this guy look like, anyways?
- Oh, he's a little guy, kinda funny-lookin'.

792
01:15:25,345 --> 01:15:28,714
- In what way?
- Oh, just in a general kind of way.

793
01:15:28,808 --> 01:15:34,347
OK, thanks. You're right, its probably
nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.

794
01:15:34,438 --> 01:15:35,897
Sure.

795
01:15:35,982 --> 01:15:41,058
- Looks like she'll turn cold tomorrow.
- Oh, yah. Got a front comin' in.

796
01:15:41,154 --> 01:15:43,644
Yah, you got that right.

797
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:04,298
Jesus Christ.

798
01:18:21,853 --> 01:18:24,141
I'm leavin' this morning, back to Brainerd.

799
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:27,730
- Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
- But you think he's all right?

800
01:18:27,818 --> 01:18:30,355
- I saw him last night and ...
- What did he say?

801
01:18:30,445 --> 01:18:35,606
Its nothing specific. It just seemed like
it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' ...

802
01:18:35,701 --> 01:18:37,360
- His wife?
- Linda.

803
01:18:37,452 --> 01:18:39,325
- Who?
- Linda Cooksey.

804
01:18:39,413 --> 01:18:41,700
No. No, no, they weren't ...

805
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:47,745
He was bothering Linda for a year, really
pestering her. Wouldn't leave her alone.

806
01:18:47,838 --> 01:18:49,580
So ...

807
01:18:49,673 --> 01:18:52,293
He didn't ... They never ...

808
01:18:52,384 --> 01:18:54,625
No. No, they never married.

809
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,633
- Mike's had psychiatric problems.
- Oh, my.

810
01:18:58,724 --> 01:19:02,672
Yah. He's been struggling.
He's living with his parents now.

811
01:19:03,727 --> 01:19:07,476
- Oh, jeez.
- Linda's fine. You should call her.

812
01:19:07,566 --> 01:19:10,898
Jeez. Well ... jeez.

813
01:19:12,736 --> 01:19:14,811
That's a surprise.

814
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:26,372
Hello?

815
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:09,575
Mr. Lundegaard. Sorry to
bother you again. Can I come in?

816
01:20:09,668 --> 01:20:12,668
Yah. No, I'm kinda busy here.

817
01:20:12,755 --> 01:20:15,126
I understand. 
I'll keep it real short, then.

818
01:20:15,214 --> 01:20:18,132
I'm on my way outta town,
but I was wondering ...

819
01:20:18,218 --> 01:20:21,337
- Mind if I sit down? Carryin' a load here.
- No. I ...

820
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:24,595
Its this vehicle I asked you about.
I was wondering ...

821
01:20:24,682 --> 01:20:27,766
Yah, like I told ya,
we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

822
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:30,267
OK. Are ya sure?

823
01:20:30,981 --> 01:20:33,056
Cos, I mean, how do you know?

824
01:20:33,441 --> 01:20:38,683
The perpetrators were driving a car with
dealer plates and called someone here,

825
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:42,991
so it would be quite a coincidence
if they weren't, you know, connected.

826
01:20:43,075 --> 01:20:46,076
- Yah, I see.
- So how do you ...

827
01:20:46,163 --> 01:20:50,076
- Have you done an inventory recently?
- The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

828
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:54,116
- How can you be sure without doin' a ...
- Well, I would know.

829
01:20:54,211 --> 01:20:57,497
- I'm the executive sales manager.
- Yah, but I understand ...

830
01:20:57,591 --> 01:21:02,382
- We run a pretty tight ship here.
- I know, but how do they establish that?

831
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:05,755
Are the cars counted daily,
or what kind of a routine here?

832
01:21:05,849 --> 01:21:08,600
Ma'am! I answered your question.

833
01:21:12,646 --> 01:21:15,980
- I'm sorry, sir?
- Ma'am, I answered your question.

834
01:21:16,735 --> 01:21:21,312
I answered the darn ...
I'm cooperating here, and there's no ...

835
01:21:24,784 --> 01:21:29,280
Sir, you have no call to get snippy
with me. I'm just doing my job here.

836
01:21:29,371 --> 01:21:31,114
I'm ...

837
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:35,582
I'm not arguin' here.

838
01:21:35,670 --> 01:21:39,418
I'm cooperating and there's no ...
We're doin' all we can.

839
01:21:46,847 --> 01:21:49,384
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

840
01:21:53,812 --> 01:21:55,770
Mr. Lundegaard.

841
01:21:58,359 --> 01:22:01,809
Well, heck!
If you wanna play games here ...

842
01:22:01,904 --> 01:22:04,608
I'm workin' with ya
on this thing here, but ...

843
01:22:04,697 --> 01:22:07,568
OK, I'll do a damn lot count.

844
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:10,150
- Sir, right now?
- Yah, right now.

845
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,367
You're darned tootin'.

846
01:22:13,456 --> 01:22:17,121
If its so damned important to ya.

847
01:22:17,211 --> 01:22:19,167
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

848
01:22:19,254 --> 01:22:21,329
Ah, what the Christ. Jesus!

849
01:23:04,924 --> 01:23:07,331
Oh, for Pete's sake.

850
01:23:11,847 --> 01:23:16,675
For Pete's sake, he's fleein' the 
interview. He's fleein' the interview!

851
01:23:17,395 --> 01:23:19,801
How do I get an outside line here?

852
01:23:21,482 --> 01:23:23,355
Great.

853
01:23:25,736 --> 01:23:27,894
Yah, Detective Sibert, please.

854
01:23:30,116 --> 01:23:32,487
I said it was over. 
I made myself clear.

855
01:23:32,576 --> 01:23:37,784
Oh, you did. You made yourself
perfectly clear, but something's come up.

856
01:23:37,873 --> 01:23:40,707
- What?
- Its something kind of small,

857
01:23:40,793 --> 01:23:43,117
but it might be a big problem.

858
01:23:43,212 --> 01:23:45,453
I'm pregnant.

859
01:23:46,173 --> 01:23:48,414
I'm pregnant.

860
01:23:49,468 --> 01:23:54,924
I've had a doctor's test and there's no
doubt about it. I'm gonna have your baby.

861
01:24:05,233 --> 01:24:07,309
You should see the other guy.

862
01:24:14,742 --> 01:24:16,735
What the fuck happened to her?

863
01:24:17,871 --> 01:24:20,540
Oh, she started shriekin', you know.

864
01:24:20,623 --> 01:24:22,531
Jesus.

865
01:24:22,625 --> 01:24:24,831
Well, I got the money.

866
01:24:24,919 --> 01:24:28,418
All of it. All 80 grand.

867
01:24:29,841 --> 01:24:32,757
That's 40 for you. 40 for me.

868
01:24:34,679 --> 01:24:36,755
That's it, then.

869
01:24:40,893 --> 01:24:43,763
You can have my truck.
I'm takin' the Ciera.

870
01:24:44,188 --> 01:24:46,644
We split that.

871
01:24:47,692 --> 01:24:52,732
How the fuck do you split a fuckin' car,
you dummy? With a fuckin' chain saw?

872
01:24:53,531 --> 01:24:56,104
One of us pays the other for half.

873
01:24:56,451 --> 01:24:59,534
Hold on. No fuckin' way.

874
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:02,620
Did you fuckin' notice this?

875
01:25:02,707 --> 01:25:04,745
I got fuckin' shot!

876
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:07,076
I got fuckin' shot in the face.

877
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:10,584
I went and got the fuckin' money.
I got shot fuckin' pickin' it up.

878
01:25:10,673 --> 01:25:13,589
I've been up for 36 fuckin' hours.

879
01:25:14,718 --> 01:25:19,759
I'm takin' that fuckin' car.
That fucker's mine, you fuckin' asshole.

880
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:23,181
I've had to listen to
your fuckin' bullshit all week.

881
01:25:23,268 --> 01:25:25,723
Are we square?

882
01:25:26,772 --> 01:25:28,930
Are we square?

883
01:25:30,651 --> 01:25:33,022
Yeah, you fuckin' mute.

884
01:25:34,779 --> 01:25:39,821
If you see your friend Shep Proudfoot,
tell him I'm gonna nail his fuckin' ass.

885
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:58,502
His wife, this guy says,
was kidnapped last Wednesday.

886
01:25:58,596 --> 01:26:01,133
- The day of our homicides.
- Yah.

887
01:26:01,222 --> 01:26:05,266
- And this guy was who?
- Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.

888
01:26:05,351 --> 01:26:08,269
- Gustafson's accountant?
- Yah.

889
01:26:08,354 --> 01:26:11,639
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

890
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:15,183
- Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.
- Still missing. We're looking.

891
01:26:15,278 --> 01:26:19,774
- Copy. And Lundegaard, too?
- Yah. Where are ya, Margie?

892
01:26:19,866 --> 01:26:22,866
I'm almost back.
I'm takin' a drive round Moose Lake.

893
01:26:22,952 --> 01:26:26,535
- Oh, Gary's loudmouth.
- Yah, the loudmouth.

894
01:26:26,623 --> 01:26:30,073
So the whole state has it?
Gustafson and Lundegaard.

895
01:26:30,168 --> 01:26:32,954
Yah, its over the wire. 
They'll find them.

896
01:26:33,046 --> 01:26:35,584
- Copy.
- Yah, we got a lead on a ...

897
01:26:35,673 --> 01:26:38,246
- There's the car! There's the car!
- Whose car?

898
01:26:38,343 --> 01:26:42,126
My car! My car! 
Tan Ciera. Tan Ciera.

899
01:26:42,221 --> 01:26:45,340
OK. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple of cars.

900
01:28:38,878 --> 01:28:40,953
Police!

901
01:28:47,804 --> 01:28:49,677
Hands up!

902
01:28:49,764 --> 01:28:51,839
Police!

903
01:28:54,434 --> 01:28:56,807
Police!

904
01:29:55,452 --> 01:29:58,572
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there?

905
01:30:03,962 --> 01:30:07,627
And I guess that was your accomplice
in the wood chipper.

906
01:30:11,845 --> 01:30:14,714
And those three people in Brainerd.

907
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:22,563
And for what?

908
01:30:22,646 --> 01:30:24,721
For a little bit of money.

909
01:30:29,946 --> 01:30:33,195
There's more to life
than a little money, you know.

910
01:30:42,916 --> 01:30:45,204
Don't you know that?

911
01:30:51,133 --> 01:30:53,089
And here y'are.

912
01:30:54,136 --> 01:30:56,627
And its a beautiful day.

913
01:31:05,355 --> 01:31:07,431
Well.

914
01:31:19,453 --> 01:31:21,528
I just don't understand it.

915
01:31:53,903 --> 01:31:58,446
Outside of Bismarck, North Dakota

916
01:32:03,954 --> 01:32:06,030
Mr. Anderson?

917
01:32:06,750 --> 01:32:08,991
- Who?
- Mr. Anderson.

918
01:32:09,085 --> 01:32:11,326
Is this your burgundy '98 out here?

919
01:32:12,922 --> 01:32:16,006
- Just a sec.
- Could you open the door, please?

920
01:32:16,092 --> 01:32:18,582
Yah, yah, just a sec.

921
01:32:18,678 --> 01:32:20,753
Just a sec.

922
01:32:29,605 --> 01:32:31,680
No!

923
01:33:10,270 --> 01:33:13,187
They announced it.

924
01:33:13,273 --> 01:33:16,310
- They announced it?
- Yah.

925
01:33:16,401 --> 01:33:18,393
So?

926
01:33:18,487 --> 01:33:20,811
Three-cent stamp.

927
01:33:20,906 --> 01:33:24,404
- Your mallard?
- Yah.

928
01:33:24,492 --> 01:33:26,568
Oh, that's terrific.

929
01:33:26,662 --> 01:33:29,946
- Its just the three-cent.
- Its terrific.

930
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:33,325
Hautmans' blue-winged teal
got the 29-cent.

931
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:35,539
People don't much use the three-cent.

932
01:33:35,629 --> 01:33:38,119
Oh, for Pete's sake, of course they do.

933
01:33:39,299 --> 01:33:43,378
Whenever they raise the postage,
people need the little stamps.

934
01:33:43,469 --> 01:33:44,547
Yah?

935
01:33:44,637 --> 01:33:47,887
When they're stuck with
a bunch of the old ones.

936
01:33:47,975 --> 01:33:51,093
Yah, I guess.

937
01:33:52,728 --> 01:33:55,848
Its terrific. 
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

938
01:33:59,277 --> 01:34:02,313
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doin' pretty good.

939
01:34:05,157 --> 01:34:07,779
I love you, Margie.

940
01:34:07,869 --> 01:34:09,944
I love you, Norm.

941
01:34:12,623 --> 01:34:14,698
Two more months.

942
01:34:17,796 --> 01:34:19,871
Two more months.
