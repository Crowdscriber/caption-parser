1
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:05,394
OK, here's the number
for poison control.

2
00:00:05,395 --> 00:00:06,426
Ask for Carol.

3
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:09,106
Honey, we're gonna be fine.
Enjoy your reunion.

4
00:00:09,107 --> 00:00:10,638
Oh, it'd be a lot more fun
if you were there.

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,143
I really am sorry about that.

6
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:15,009
- I just can't miss the chance
to bowl on Jay's team. - Mnh.

7
00:00:15,127 --> 00:00:17,289
That's why I ordered
these glide rights.

8
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,101
If you break 'em in properly,
they're supposed to give you

9
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,725
a completely frictionless--

10
00:00:23,054 --> 00:00:26,159
If I'm being honest, the reunion
might be a little more fun

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,364
if Phil isn't there.

12
00:00:27,365 --> 00:00:29,813
Otherwise, I spend the whole
weekend telling him who's who

13
00:00:29,814 --> 00:00:31,707
and explaining inside jokes.

14
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,575
And if all that explaining
is going out,

15
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:36,123
the alcohol is not going in.

16
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:38,865
Hey, mom. Before you go,
you have to sign this for school. Mm.

17
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:40,472
You don't have to read it.
It's all boilerplate.

18
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:43,113
Honey, I am running really late.
Ask your dad.

19
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:44,272
Right here, buddy.

20
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:45,497
S--uhh!

21
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,610
I have to get the letter signed

22
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:49,500
because I failed my assignment
on the revolutionary war.

23
00:00:49,618 --> 00:00:51,360
I recreated the Battle of Bunker Hill

24
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:53,305
using one of my old
science projects.

25
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:55,138
Seemed pretty revolutionary to me.

26
00:00:55,477 --> 00:00:58,187
The brave patriots made
their way up the hillside,

27
00:00:58,188 --> 00:01:01,729
prepared for whatever the devious
red coats might inflict next.

28
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,592
Now you work?!

29
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:07,996
- So, dad--
- One second, buddy.

30
00:01:08,103 --> 00:01:09,977
The salesman said when
you're breaking these shoes in,

31
00:01:09,978 --> 00:01:12,137
it's easier to move side to side.

32
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:13,863
Son of a gun.

33
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:15,595
He was right.

34
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:16,647
What do we got here?
Uhh!

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,074

37
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,027
I've waited a year for this day--

38
00:01:34,117 --> 00:01:37,021
the annual trade association
scratch bowling tournament.

39
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,474
Last year, we lost
to our biggest rival.

40
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:40,933
Frazier had Ali.

41
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:44,619
Pritchett's closets has closets,
closets, closets, closets.

42
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,628
It's a stupid name,
but those cats can bowl.

43
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:51,263
Ay, I knew the pancakes
would bring you down.

44
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,840
Just coffee for me today.

45
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:54,996
Black, like I feel on the inside.

46
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:58,513
Ay, Manny.
Please, it was only one bad audition.

47
00:01:58,514 --> 00:02:00,612
No, three bad auditions--

48
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:03,973
fall assembly, "Phantom,"
and now the spring sing.

49
00:02:04,136 --> 00:02:05,248
I'm a disaster.

50
00:02:05,249 --> 00:02:06,764
You're always so dramatic.

51
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:07,645
Dramatic, mother?

52
00:02:07,646 --> 00:02:10,541
I am sure that Cam is gonna call you
today and give you the solo.

53
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,545
You're always so hard on yourself.

54
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:16,114
Remember that you said that
you didn't have a face for hats?

55
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,609
- And?
- I look great in every hat.

56
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,753
I can't hear you.

57
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,427
I look great in every hat.

58
00:02:21,428 --> 00:02:23,530
Well, enjoy that while it lasts.

59
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,652
I had a pretty good hat run,

60
00:02:24,653 --> 00:02:27,526
but then I saw a photo of myself
from the dude ranch.

61
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,984
I looked like Reba
at the Grammys.

62
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:31,253
I see that you found the fur.

63
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:34,326
Yes. Uh, you wouldn't happen
to have a feather boa, would you?

64
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:35,813
Are you wearing that
to your Oscar party?

65
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:37,894
No, Manny. We're not cliches.

66
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:39,062
Cam's decorating the party

67
00:02:39,063 --> 00:02:41,764
with photos of Lily dressed
as different starlets from the--

68
00:02:41,765 --> 00:02:43,175
w-we--we're cliches.

69
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:44,496
Hey, Gloria,

70
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,473
look what I found in my bowling bag.

71
00:02:46,495 --> 00:02:48,724
Second place prize
in last year's tournament--

72
00:02:48,725 --> 00:02:50,117
A spa day.

73
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:52,899
Oh, but it expires today.

74
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,024
Oh. Sorry.

75
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,144
I just wish that I could use this.

76
00:02:56,145 --> 00:02:57,623
But today's the nanny's day off,

77
00:02:57,624 --> 00:02:59,288
and I have a million things to do.

78
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:03,109
I have to buy diapers,
I have to go pick up the stroller,

79
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,798
I have to go to the doctor.

80
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,912
I hate wasting this, but...

81
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,651
I just don't have any time today.

82
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,398
Yes, I would have loved
to go to the spa,

83
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:15,406
but having a baby
has changed completely

84
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:17,711
the way that
Jay's family look at me.

85
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:21,506
I am not anymore just Gloria
that has her hair done,

86
00:03:21,507 --> 00:03:23,581
Gloria that goes to the gym.

87
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:25,975
Now I am Gloria the new mother--

88
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,256
the "I don't know
how she does it" lady.

89
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:31,490
If the feather boa is not here,
it's at my cousin's.

90
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:33,931
I will go get it after the doctor,
after the pharmacy,

91
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:35,616
before the baby store, okay?

92
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,629
Honestly, Gloria,
I don't know how you do it.

93
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,277
Ah, found it!

94
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,915
- Help me.
- Careful.

95
00:03:43,755 --> 00:03:45,396
- G--ooh! Oh, Gloria! Are you all right?
- Ay! Aah!

96
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,163
Ay, I told you to help me!

97
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:49,407
- I am so sorry!
- I twisted my ankle.

98
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:50,937
Okay. Sit down right here.

99
00:03:51,004 --> 00:03:52,555
I don't have time for this.

100
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:54,653
No, you-- you can't walk around
on that all day.

101
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,463
No, I'm good. I'm good.

102
00:03:56,524 --> 00:03:58,875
No. I will use...

103
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:03,181
the baby carrier as a...
as a cane. Okay?

104
00:04:03,182 --> 00:04:04,323
O-okay.

105
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,092
Now hold that. Hold that.
Good, good, good.

106
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:09,974
Now smolder. Smolder.

107
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,775
Perfect. Perfect.

108
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:12,826
Let me guess--

109
00:04:12,827 --> 00:04:14,972
you couldn't remember
if I said "boa" or "baby,"

110
00:04:14,973 --> 00:04:16,636
so you brought both.

111
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:18,492
Gloria hurt herself,

112
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:21,790
and it was kinda my fault,
so I offered to watch Joe.

113
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,655
Can I take a break?
I wanna be alone.

114
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:27,929
Okay, where was that attitude
when we were doing Greta Garbo?

115
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:30,003
Okay, fine. Take five.

116
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:32,404
Hi, baby Joe.

117
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,197
Why don't you just sit a spell?

118
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:35,711
We're just makin' pictures.

119
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:37,306
- Why are you being all Missouri?
- I don't know.

120
00:04:37,307 --> 00:04:39,625
I guess I'm excited to go back
to the farm. Is it that obvious?

121
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:42,315
- You said "dagburn" at breakfast.
- Have you booked our tickets yet?

122
00:04:42,316 --> 00:04:44,192
You know, I-I'm sure
if I can get off work.

123
00:04:44,193 --> 00:04:44,979
Yeah, but you have
to get the tickets

124
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,836
before all the good seats are taken.

125
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:48,462
You mean the ones that
aren't on a plane to Missouri?

126
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:49,743
Okay, sweetie, break's over.

127
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:51,222
It hasn't been five minutes.

128
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:53,219
Yes, but it has been
five animal crackers.

129
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,699
Which is five too many
to eat on a shoot day. So...

130
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,861
No more! I quit!

131
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,181
Oh, my gosh.
What has gotten into her?

132
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:01,431
We've been doing
this for six hours,

133
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:02,818
and now all of the sudden,
she doesn't love it?

134
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:04,353
You know, I have a theory.

135
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,442
Okay.

136
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:06,603
Well, we're only halfway through

137
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:07,797
all the pictures that I wanted to do.

138
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:10,638
Lightbulb.
Hello, baby Joe!

139
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:13,056
Well, you may as well be

140
00:05:13,057 --> 00:05:15,526
a dead hobo in the woods
of a small town

141
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:19,459
after a rainstorm, because
you have just been discovered.

142
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,656
I'm looking less and less forward

143
00:05:20,657 --> 00:05:22,209
to this trip to Missouri.

144
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,576
Hey, handsome.

145
00:05:24,577 --> 00:05:26,833
Uh, can you sign this?
You don't need to read it.

146
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:28,298
Never do!

147
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,141
Right there.

148
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:33,932
Oh. Quick-- 
Nature's sure-fire sunburn remedy?

149
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:35,706
Aloe?

150
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:39,463
Hey, Jay. Super excited
about our big match.

151
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,346
I dreamt about it last night.
Guess what? We won!

152
00:05:42,347 --> 00:05:44,331
Phil, I like you
too much to sugarcoat

153
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:47,041
what I'm about to say--
You're off the team.

154
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,915
Good one. Loosen me up with
some pre-match humor. I like it.

155
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,879
Nah, I found somebody better-- 
Rudy Sorrenson.

156
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,297
He's in, you're out.

157
00:05:54,298 --> 00:05:56,010
Hilarious!

158
00:05:56,179 --> 00:05:57,548
Stickin' with the bit.

159
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:59,596
I love that this is
our relationship now.

160
00:05:59,597 --> 00:06:01,468
This match is too important,
and you're a wild card.

161
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,251
I'm sorry.

162
00:06:02,252 --> 00:06:03,276
Jay...

163
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:06,295
I'm not sure I like
where this is headed.

164
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:08,956
Phil, this is nothing personal.
It's bowling.

165
00:06:08,957 --> 00:06:10,234
No, no, no. I get it.

166
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:13,918
Listen, um... I should get goin'.

167
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:16,069
My allergies are starting to cry.

168
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:23,842
Hey, Gloria. I was just
about to leave. What's up?

169
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:26,344
Manny just texted me. 
Did he tell you the news?

170
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,803
Yes. Wonderful. 
We'll celebrate later.

171
00:06:28,804 --> 00:06:30,709
No. He didn't get the solo.

172
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,707
I think he's very upset.

173
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,439
- Aah!
- My glove.

174
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,311
Where are you?

175
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,576
At the doctor. 
He's checking my ankle.

176
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:40,560
Jay, I think you should 
try to cheer him up.

177
00:06:40,561 --> 00:06:42,256
Why don't you take him shopping?

178
00:06:42,257 --> 00:06:44,818
Gloria, my match is at 5:00. 
I have a ritual.

179
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:47,602
I walk the lanes. 
I play two or three warm-up games.

180
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:50,286
He's fine. 
I'll let you talk to him.

181
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:53,953
Darkness, please.

182
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,666
Aw, shoot.
He's out in the pool.

183
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,786
What do I have to do 
to make you go away? Sing?

184
00:06:57,878 --> 00:06:59,421
Uh, I'll have him call you back.

185
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:02,269
My life is a music-less, 
gray hellscape.

186
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,926
Wow. Well, this doesn't look

187
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:05,639
like anything shopping 
can help you with.

188
00:07:05,837 --> 00:07:07,293
It's worth a shot.

189
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:20,239
Sorry I was so indecisive back there.
I'm out of it today.

190
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,293
Well, you got what you want,

191
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:22,372
and that's what today is all about.

192
00:07:22,373 --> 00:07:24,253
Turn that frown upside-down.

193
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:26,576
Now you're gonna take
this 15 local to get home.

194
00:07:26,577 --> 00:07:28,184
Keep both your hands
tight on that bag

195
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:29,973
because it goes through
a few sketchy blocks.

196
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:31,187
You're not driving me?

197
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:32,890
Well, you kinda used up
your drive time

198
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:35,074
deciding between
those identical belts.

199
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,871
Okay. It's just hard.
You know, Jay?

200
00:07:37,872 --> 00:07:39,627
I mean, I've never been a quitter.

201
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:41,908
Well, new chapter for you.
You got any change?

202
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,715
I mean, I always imagined 
I'd be a performer for life.

203
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:46,435
I guess some dreams
you just have to give up on.

204
00:07:46,436 --> 00:07:47,336
Know when to fold 'em.

205
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:49,730
Here's a $50. 
Someone will have change.

206
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:52,188
I can't sing, period.

207
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,555
What am I thinking?

208
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,481
The 11 goes right by the house,
and there she is.

209
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:00,340
Now text your mom
when you get home.

210
00:08:02,163 --> 00:08:03,659
Good luck with your bowling!

211
00:08:03,769 --> 00:08:04,864
Thanks, kid!

212
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,712
Yes. Yes!

213
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,670
We've had my dad's baby
for 45 minutes,

214
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:15,640
and he's already in a dress.

215
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:18,467
Okay, Lily, I think we're ready
for our most important setup--

216
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,436
- miss Shirley Temple.
- Here.

217
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:23,044
Oh, wow. You're an even better
assistant than you are a model.

218
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,102
I don't care.

219
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,257
Okay, well, that came
through in her modeling.

220
00:08:26,258 --> 00:08:27,285
Our daughter.

221
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:29,319
Okay, I know,
but it just hurts, Mitchell.

222
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,144
It's the first one of our things 
that she's outgrown.

223
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,048
Well, you know, but isn't it great
that we've raised her

224
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,103
to have opinions and
interests of her own?

225
00:08:36,104 --> 00:08:38,582
But this early?
She's still so daggum young.

226
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,857
Okay, is that
another Southern thing,

227
00:08:39,858 --> 00:08:41,970
or are you just trying to remember
her vietnamese name?

228
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:43,846
Oh, my gosh.
This thing is stuck.

229
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,401
What? How--how could it be?

230
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:46,801
- It is stuck.
- Oh!

231
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:48,193
I glued it.

232
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,883
W-w-why--why would you do that?

233
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:53,448
Because the Jane Crawford wig
kept falling off him.

234
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,886
- It's Joan Crawford.
- 'Cause that's what's important here.

235
00:08:55,887 --> 00:08:58,512
Okay. It's--it's glued
to his actual hair.

236
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:00,090
Okay, Lily,

237
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:03,165
this is bad.
This is very, very bad.

238
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,207
Sorry. I was trying to help.

239
00:09:05,349 --> 00:09:06,911
Okay. Well, I should've seen this coming.

240
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:08,314
I replaced her
with somebody younger,

241
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,995
and she sabotaged Joe's shoot 
out of sheer jealousy.

242
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,383
Maybe she does have
what it takes to be a model.

243
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,163
Can you...

244
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,291
- Sing!
- What?

245
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:23,518
I've heard you sing in the shower.

246
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,776
You sing in the car with me.
You never miss a note!

247
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:28,010
Your problem is doing it
around people. Sing!

248
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:29,604
- You want me to sing now?
- Yeah!

249
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:30,786
It's all in your head!

250
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,344
When you get over
that little stage fright,

251
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,593
you'll never choke
an audition again. Sing!

252
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:39,522
♪ I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate ♪
- Thats's not singing. Attack it!

253
00:09:39,722 --> 00:09:40,922
♪ a pawn and a king. ♪

254
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:44,722
♪ I've been up and down and over and out
and I know one thing ♪

255
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:46,960
What's that thing?!

256
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,560
♪ Each time I find myself
flat on my face ♪

257
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,800
Yeah, now you got it!

258
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,300
♪ I pick myself up ♪
- Get that big, I know you want to!

259
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,200
♪ and get back in the race. ♪
- Yeah!

260
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,600
♪ That's life! ♪
- Sing it to me, baby!

261
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,722
♪ That's what people say ♪

262
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:05,877
Oh, my God. Is that Janie Gibbs?

263
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:08,046
Yikes. Her skin looks like

264
00:10:08,047 --> 00:10:10,729
crumpled tinfoil you try
to smooth out and use again.

265
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,690
Remind me not to
get old in front of you.

266
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:17,580
I don't even see the kids'
faces anymore.

267
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:21,248
I know them by the decals
on their laptops.

268
00:10:21,249 --> 00:10:22,586
Professor Cooke.

269
00:10:23,254 --> 00:10:25,243
Still the sexiest man on campus.

270
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:27,138
- Wanna know a little somethin'?
- You dated him.

271
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:28,308
How did you know that?

272
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:29,981
We were so careful
with that secret.

273
00:10:29,982 --> 00:10:32,548
You wore an oversized
tweed jacket to breakfast

274
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,278
and called my rabbit
convertible "Bourgeois."

275
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:35,764
Well, it kinda was.

276
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:37,635
- We were so jealous of you.
- Mm.

277
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,948
He was so hot,

278
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:41,312
jogging around campus
in those dolphin shorts.

279
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:43,329
And that wasn't even
why I was with him.

280
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,941
It was his mind.

281
00:10:44,942 --> 00:10:46,021
Do you know those people

282
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,726
who make you feel smart
just by being near them?

283
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,015
I watched you guys once.

284
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,072
Claire!

285
00:10:53,223 --> 00:10:54,320
Claire's friend!

286
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,594
He remembers me.

287
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,512
Hello, Professor.

288
00:10:59,677 --> 00:11:00,544
Wow.

289
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:02,216
It's so good to see you.

290
00:11:02,217 --> 00:11:05,152
Clearly, the academic life
agrees with you.

291
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:07,183
Oh, I guess we're
all doing pretty well.

292
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,225
- Mm-hmm.
- Cheers.

293
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:08,926
Cheers.

294
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,434
Here's lookin' at you, too.

295
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:12,267
- Oh.
- Were you always like this?

296
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,160
Claire?

297
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,534
Oh, my God. No way.

298
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,820
- Tater! Oh, my gosh!
- Aah!

299
00:11:17,765 --> 00:11:19,862
I heard you're hugely successful.

300
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,603
Yeah, well, you know, when all
the hot girls call you "Tater,"

301
00:11:22,604 --> 00:11:24,035
you tend to try a little harder.

302
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:26,012
Adorable. Adorable!

303
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:27,640
- You're adorable!
- Claire!

304
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,295
- Mwah!
- Honey! Hey!

305
00:11:29,296 --> 00:11:32,380
- Hi, Phil! What are you doing here?
- Hey.

306
00:11:32,821 --> 00:11:34,852
Uh... your dad dumped me
from his bowling team,

307
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:36,509
so I thought I'd surprise you.

308
00:11:37,642 --> 00:11:39,395
Okay. Wait.
Come here a second.

309
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:41,904
I-I thought you'd be
happy to see me.

310
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:43,590
I am! No, I am!

311
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:44,563
I am happy.

312
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:45,787
Is something wrong?

313
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:48,914
It's just-- 
it's a little bit embarrassing.

314
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:51,770
The guy that I dated
right before you is here, so...

315
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:53,140
Oh. Well, that's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

316
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:53,984
We all have exes.

317
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:55,859
So the guy you dumped
right before you met me is here.

318
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,126
No big deal.

319
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:58,718
Well...

320
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,236
Mnh, he might've dumped me.

321
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,269
I thought you said
you'd never been dumped.

322
00:12:02,553 --> 00:12:05,469
Well... maybe one time.

323
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:08,091
So... he dumped you,

324
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:11,147
you healed completely,
and then you met me.

325
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,314
Well...

326
00:12:14,955 --> 00:12:16,201
I've regretted throwing away things

327
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,075
way more beaten up than Claire.

328
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:21,514
So if this campus Casanova
had thoughts of reclaiming her,

329
00:12:21,515 --> 00:12:22,895
guess what, hot shot?

330
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:25,171
Legally, I still own her.

331
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:28,803
Man, I always wondered
who'd be lucky enough to marry

332
00:12:28,804 --> 00:12:30,447
the beautiful Claire Pritchett.

333
00:12:31,095 --> 00:12:32,878
No luck involved, hombre.

334
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,407
She saw, she liked,
she got pregnant, she had to.

335
00:12:35,408 --> 00:12:37,319
Hey! Stop hogging this guy.

336
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,931
I haven't seen him in 20 years.

337
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:39,606
- Mm. Mnh.
- My Tater.

338
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:40,904
Look, I've gotta run,

339
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:42,971
but I'd love to have
you guys by my apartment

340
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,700
for a cocktail before dinner.

341
00:12:44,749 --> 00:12:46,305
Oh! We are totally doing that.

342
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:47,926
Oh. We might have
to go back to the hotel--

343
00:12:47,927 --> 00:12:50,112
No, no, no.
Ah, that's what this weekend's for.

344
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:52,495
- Having a laugh, meetin' new people.
- Yeah.

345
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:54,645
I don't want to miss any of it.

346
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,361
And I don't miss much.

347
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:03,781
Close the door!
You're letting the steam out!

348
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:04,953
Is the wig coming loose?

349
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:07,100
Oh, yes, Mitchell.
It's completely off his head.

350
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:08,022
We're just staying in here

351
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:10,133
because there's nothing babies
and big guys love more

352
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:11,956
- than 100% humidity.
- Oh, my God.

353
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,389
Do you realize what Gloria's
gonna do when she sees this?

354
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,817
She punched me when I got
Manny that henna tattoo.

355
00:13:16,818 --> 00:13:19,021
And not the side-of-the-hand
way that I do it.

356
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,513
This had rings and knuckles.

357
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:23,761
Don't worry.
I'm working on a plan "B."

358
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:26,070
Or should I say...

359
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:28,110
- Plan Bieber?
- No.

360
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,487
Huh? No, I just gave him
a little bit of a haircut.

361
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:31,379
Give me the baby.
I know. Yes!

362
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:38,964
I mean, that's the great part
of my schedule.

363
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,470
We make it to Europe
almost every summer.

364
00:13:41,471 --> 00:13:43,113
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm sure you guys travel.

365
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:45,053
Well, honestly, I don't think
I've been anywhere

366
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:47,278
without a water slide in 15 years.

367
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:49,279
That's funny.

368
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,800
She's mentioned Esther, Dougie,

369
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:54,242
Tripp, afro Judy...

370
00:13:54,297 --> 00:13:57,274
The name "Tater" has literally
never even come up once

371
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,789
in the last 20 years.

372
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,206
Oh, I don't know why I'm surprised.

373
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,067
I was madly in love with her
for four years...

374
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:03,560
And I was basically invisible

375
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,537
until the day I choked
on that tater tot.

376
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,811
Wait. Uh, I-I thought
you were her ex.

377
00:14:07,812 --> 00:14:09,100
I wish.

378
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,616
Oh! So, Phil,
are you here all weekend?

379
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,132
No.

380
00:14:15,133 --> 00:14:17,948
Well, that's too bad.
I was gonna suggest some activities.

381
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:18,840
The Palmer center is doing

382
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:21,322
a wonderful retrospective
of impressionists.

383
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:23,031
Oh. That is a shame.

384
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,992
That's a field I know
quite a bit about.

385
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,548
- Ah.
- Phil. No.

386
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:28,390
Uh, you can see the influence,
can't you,

387
00:14:28,391 --> 00:14:31,319
of the, uh, early impressionists?

388
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:32,672
The, uh...

389
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:33,999
Rich Littles,

390
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,327
the Frank Gorshins,

391
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:38,093
on the...
Jimmy Fallons, if you will.

392
00:14:38,094 --> 00:14:39,202
He meant the painter kind.

393
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:39,982
Yes.

394
00:14:39,983 --> 00:14:42,285
- Freshen your drink?
- No. No, not done.

395
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:43,764
You'd know if I was
finished with something,

396
00:14:43,765 --> 00:14:45,603
- and I'm not.
- Oh. Hmm.

397
00:14:45,946 --> 00:14:47,801
- Oh. Just the one then.
- Yeah.

398
00:14:49,064 --> 00:14:49,651
What are you doing?

399
00:14:49,652 --> 00:14:51,846
Sorry. Did I embarrass you
in front of your ex-boyfriend?

400
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:52,967
Yeah, I know about that.

401
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:55,887
Because I told you. Come on.
You can't seriously be jealous.

402
00:14:56,054 --> 00:14:57,077
Well...

403
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:59,003
Phil, it was 20 years ago.

404
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:01,022
Reign it in.

405
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:03,213
Come on.
You're embarrassing me a little.

406
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:04,942
Fine, but do you deny
that part of the reason

407
00:15:04,943 --> 00:15:07,622
you wanted to come back here
by yourself is that guy?

408
00:15:07,979 --> 00:15:09,642
I'm not even sure
it's a bad thing, Claire.

409
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,514
We all wonder about
the paths we didn't follow,

410
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:13,076
but you could admit it.

411
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:17,338
Well, you can't be mad
at me if I do admit it.

412
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:18,946
I won't.

413
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:21,981
Well, I'm not... admitting it,

414
00:15:21,982 --> 00:15:25,070
because I couldn't be happier
than I am in my life with you.

415
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:26,420
But, mm...

416
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:29,111
I mean... maybe...

417
00:15:29,144 --> 00:15:33,197
A tiny part of me just wanted to sort
of peek through the window

418
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,078
and... see the life
that might've been.

419
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,991
Never get tired
of those three flights.

420
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:41,087
Maggie!

421
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:43,049
Say hi to everyone.

422
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,161
In a second, angel.

423
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:46,604
Mama's had a day.

424
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:49,901
Oh, I thought that was the bedroom.

425
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:51,462
You're in the bedroom, honey...

426
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,047
And the living room and the study

427
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,193
and the gym.

428
00:15:55,485 --> 00:15:56,341
Mm. But anyway...

429
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:58,004
Listen to me. I'm being rude.

430
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:00,469
How is everybody? 
How's things?

431
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,221
- Not too bad.
- Actually--

432
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:04,510
No, I'm literally asking you,
how is it to have things?

433
00:16:07,044 --> 00:16:08,925
Oh. Yep, right on schedule.

434
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,643
Keep it down, ya hood rats!

435
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:12,620
Maggie, you were once a student.

436
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:13,845
I remember.

437
00:16:13,852 --> 00:16:16,532
That's when I boarded
this little rocket ship to the moon.

438
00:16:21,577 --> 00:16:22,135
Wow.

439
00:16:22,136 --> 00:16:23,726
Phil, wait. Thank you.

440
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:26,111
- For what?
- Everything.

441
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:28,375
I'm not sure how that guy
got to be a Professor.

442
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:30,511
He'd have to be pretty stupid
to dump you.

443
00:16:32,043 --> 00:16:33,308
Hey, the party's starting,

444
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,331
and there's a really
good-looking guy

445
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:36,804
I was hoping to do
a little dancing with, so...

446
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:38,027
- You mean me?
- Yes.

447
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:38,987
Wait. Before we go,

448
00:16:38,988 --> 00:16:40,727
are there any more exes
I should know about?

449
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:42,326
Honey, what do you think I was like?

450
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,182
Hey, Claire Pritchett!

451
00:16:44,247 --> 00:16:46,111
Hey, Dean Stoller!

452
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,516
Super quick story.

453
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:53,055
All right, it's not
too late for plan "C"--

454
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:54,718
We drop the baby and run.

455
00:16:54,719 --> 00:16:57,383
What? No. You have
to tell her what you did.

456
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,621
You scalped her baby.

457
00:16:58,622 --> 00:17:02,118
I had to cut that wig off.
What did you expect me to do?

458
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:03,381
He keeps pulling his hat off.

459
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:04,546
Okay, well,
you could've let me do it.

460
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:06,852
I have 32 hours
of Vidal Sassoon training.

461
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,708
What? I left the program over
creative differences. Shut up.

462
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,783
Hola!

463
00:17:11,784 --> 00:17:13,776
- Hola!
- Hola!

464
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:17,266
Oh! There's my little angel.

465
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,337
Mm. How was he?

466
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,470
Uh... there-- there's
a funny story here.

467
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:22,269
Gloria! Um--

468
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,950
forgot about that baby...

469
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:26,142
And check out this one!

470
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:30,171
You beat closets, closets,
closets, closets, closets?!

471
00:17:30,172 --> 00:17:31,578
We destroyed them!

472
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,544
And it's closets,
closets, closets, closets.

473
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,412
- What did I say? - We went
through this for a half-hour yesterday.

474
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:36,771
I can't do it again.

475
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:38,509
Nope.
You're gonna have to tell her.

476
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,538
What? Why?

477
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,137
Because she has two new rings.

478
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:42,784
That--that's gonna take
the meat right off the bone.

479
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:44,590
Okay, Cam,
you take the fall for me,

480
00:17:44,591 --> 00:17:46,467
and I will go with you to Missouri.

481
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:47,933
I'll even go for a whole week.

482
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,365
Make it ten days.

483
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:50,020
Okay, fine.

484
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:51,467
But I don't want to meet
anything on Monday

485
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:52,674
that I'm gonna eat on Friday.

486
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:54,056
Oh, well, that's gonna happen.

487
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,924
Oh! My perfect angel!

488
00:17:56,925 --> 00:17:58,645
You got this. You're good.

489
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,777
You know, Gloria, do you remember

490
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:02,660
that chafing dish I lent you
a couple months back

491
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:03,925
that you returned
with a chip in it?

492
00:18:03,926 --> 00:18:06,155
Every time that Luke comes over,

493
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:08,894
he takes things out of the attic
and leaves them just...

494
00:18:08,895 --> 00:18:09,902
everywhere!

495
00:18:09,903 --> 00:18:11,260
Oh. Yeah.

496
00:18:11,261 --> 00:18:13,518
Well, you know, funny thing
about that chafing dish

497
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,422
is it was my grandmother's,
and it was given to her--

498
00:18:16,423 --> 00:18:17,671
Luke!

499
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:24,125
Oh, hey, Manny.
Glad I ran into you.

500
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:26,485
Listen, I'm gonna give you the solo.

501
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:29,086
Really? You must've heard
what happened to me today.

502
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,607
I feel confident now
and I know I can do--

503
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:31,841
yeah, I don't care about,
any of that stuff.

504
00:18:31,842 --> 00:18:33,296
I just need you to tell you mom

505
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:35,048
that you gave your brother Joe
a haircut, okay?

506
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,753
No problem.
How bad could it be?

507
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:43,439
Anyway, I heard you need
a letter from school signed.

508
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,136
I kinda nailed my Declaration
of Independence replica.

509
00:18:46,137 --> 00:18:48,160
Forged every signature
with this pen.

510
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:49,263
- So--
- Stop.

511
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:50,440
We have a deal.

512
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:52,302
I'll say I cut the baby's hair.

513
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:53,609
And you give me that cool pen.

514
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,209
- What? No. No, that's not what
I was going to-- - A deal's a deal.

515
00:18:57,724 --> 00:18:59,022
A thief, Lily.

516
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:01,324
That's who ate
my last piece of cake

517
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:04,341
that my mother send me
specially from Colombia.

518
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,437
It helps you make the milk.

519
00:19:09,956 --> 00:19:11,507
Such a cool trophy.

520
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,016
Say, how'd that new
guy Rudy Sorrenson do?

521
00:19:14,017 --> 00:19:14,897
He was great.

522
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:16,447
It's funny how he has
the same name

523
00:19:16,448 --> 00:19:19,225
as one-time pro bowler
Rudolph Sorrenson,

524
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:21,802
which would be
against league rules.

525
00:19:22,168 --> 00:19:23,776
Well, I'd find it funny.

526
00:19:25,714 --> 00:19:28,713
Jay, hurry up. You have
to take the kids to the movie.

527
00:19:29,463 --> 00:19:31,758
And why does the baby
still have that hat on?

528
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:32,875
He's going to burn up.

529
00:19:32,876 --> 00:19:35,180
Gloria, I have a confession to make.

530
00:19:35,356 --> 00:19:37,004
I gave Joe a haircut.

531
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:38,655
It's bad.

532
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:39,785
Why would you do that?

533
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:41,940
My dad used to cut my hair
when I was a kid,

534
00:19:41,941 --> 00:19:44,175
and I thought it'd be a nice way
for the baby and me to bond.

535
00:19:44,176 --> 00:19:47,040
But I just made a mess of things...

536
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:50,180
Like I... make a mess of everything.

537
00:19:50,609 --> 00:19:52,226
Let me take a look at this.

538
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:54,770
- Oh! Ay, dios mio!
- Hey! Wow. It's really bad.

539
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:57,341
Dad, why would you do that
to your own son?

540
00:19:57,342 --> 00:19:58,758
He's just a baby.

541
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:00,159
Plus you ate that cake.

542
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,417
Okay, enough.
Leave him alone.

543
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,946
He could have invented
some crazy story,

544
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:07,388
but instead he decided
to tell the truth.

545
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,827
That's what families do.

546
00:20:08,828 --> 00:20:09,874
- Yes, it is.
- Mm-hmm. Right.

547
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,673
Okay, go. Go, go, go.

548
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:14,528
Okay. Uh, Lily, sweetie,
we're leaving! Come on!

549
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:18,338
I know that they expected me
to go all Colombian crazy.

550
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:21,557
But this was just another opportunity
for me to show them

551
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:24,837
that I was not the superficial
Gloria that I used to be.

552
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:28,620
Plus I was very relaxed
after the day I had.

553
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:35,388
Aah! Where are you?

554
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:38,245
At the doctor.
He's checking my ankle.

555
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:42,247
What? Did you think I was gonna
throw away a whole spa day?

556
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:48,497
I'm coming, Fulgencio!

557
00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,510
Why am I doing this again?

558
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:00,984
Dad'll get a kick out of it.

559
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,362
Like when we were young
and used to wear his shoes.

560
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:05,083
Now get up and
take a few steps.

561
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,877
Did dad ask for this?

562
00:21:12,878 --> 00:21:15,268
No, but he'll love it. 
Maybe dance around.

563
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,326
Okay, now jump.

564
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,548
What kind of video is this?

565
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,490
You know what? 
I've gotta go to work. I'm sorry.

566
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,859
Okay, thanks!

567
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,217
What the hell?

568
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:34,521
Finally!

569
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:40,992
