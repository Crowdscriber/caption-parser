00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:05,078
Good morning, Jackie.

3
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:07,895
- Have you ever considered serving
in the leadership? - Me as whip?

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,272
Your replacement as whip, Frank. Bob has
already shared some thoughts.

5
00:00:10,297 --> 00:00:12,308
Mr. President,
what if we let the caucus pick?

6
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:14,033
This is safe, Zoe. I'm not him.

7
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:16,139
Russo was in the passenger
seat when he died.

8
00:00:16,164 --> 00:00:17,923
And you think I was involved?

9
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:19,386
I'm just asking questions.

10
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:21,233
You're connecting dots
that don't exist.

11
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,560
- I'm not gonna fuck him.
- I just don't want you to be careless.

12
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:26,450
- Have you ever killed anyone?
- No.

<i>This is not the most inspiring
choice for vice president, right?</i>

15
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>A well-respected operator,</i>
<i>pragmatic, but let's face it,</i>

16
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,281
<i>this is probably just a nod
to Congress, tapping one of their own.</i>

17
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>It's really nothing more than
a placeholder until 2016, assuredly.</i>

18
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,960
<i>I'm not surprised he's doing</i>
<i>a private swearing-in.</i>

19
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:14,800
<i>My bet is the president wants to draw
as little attention to this as possible.</i>

20
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:17,482
<i>There's just</i>
<i>no real wow factor...</i>

21
00:01:22,961 --> 00:01:24,840
Christina's working out well?

22
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:27,320
She's getting her sea legs, but
I've been happy so far.

23
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,320
- She works hard.
- It's a big load off my shoulders

24
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:31,680
when she can travel with the
president instead of me.

25
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:34,561
I get so much more done
when I stay here.

26
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:38,280
President have a preference
in the whip's race?

27
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,040
I can't believe how ugly
it's gotten.

28
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:41,761
He was more disappointed
than anything else...

29
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:44,440
- Watch out, Wes.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

30
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:46,320
- Not at all.
- This is something else.

31
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:48,361
Security specs. They had
to work fast. Watch yourself.

32
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:50,040
It's like a war zone
around here.

33
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,120
The idea is to keep
the war from getting in.

34
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:54,000
How's the whip's race coming,
Congressman?

35
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:55,400
It's tight between
you and Howard?

36
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:56,800
Well, you'd have to ask Howard,

37
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:58,921
if he's not too busy
trying to sodomize me.

38
00:01:58,922 --> 00:02:01,802
- Should we go say hello? - For God sakes,
don't make me talk to that man.

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,280
- Good to see you, Howard.
- Nice to see you, Wes.

40
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,161
Yeah, I bet it is.

41
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,880
- Bob.
- Frank.

42
00:02:24,881 --> 00:02:26,480
- Thanks for inviting me, Frank.
- What?

43
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,240
- Thanks for inviting me.
- You bet.

44
00:02:28,241 --> 00:02:33,481
- Hey, Frank.
- Judge! Good to see you.

45
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:36,201
- Is there somewhere I can go to change?
- Yes, absolutely.

46
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:38,840
There's room down the hall.
Doug, will you take care of the judge?

47
00:02:38,841 --> 00:02:40,880
And when he's ready,
let's get this thing over with.

48
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:42,440
I'll start bringing 'em in.

49
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:44,360
"That I take this
obligation freely,

50
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:47,721
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion..."

51
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:49,440
That I take
this obligation freely,

52
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:51,680
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion...

53
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:53,120
"...and that I will..."

54
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,721
One heartbeat away
from the presidency,

55
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:56,960
and not a single
vote cast in my name.

56
00:02:56,961 --> 00:03:00,640
- Democracy is so overrated.
- "...on which I am about to enter,

57
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,560
- so help me God."
- ...and that I will well and faithfully

58
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:08,680
discharge the duties of the office on
which I am about to enter, so help me God.

59
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:12,561
- Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

60
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:25,761
All right, let's get back
to running the country.

61

62
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,000
Now, one of you is
gonna replace me as the whip.

63
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,280
You're the two frontrunners
and we know you both want it.

64
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:03,479
You're not behaving
like men who belong in the leadership.

65
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,800
We need to tone
down the rhetoric.

66
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,080
- You're hurting the party.
- I'm just responding

67
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:09,560
to the lies Howard's
been slinging.

68
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:11,760
Those junkets happened, Wes.
I'm not making it up.

69
00:05:11,761 --> 00:05:14,039
- And nepotism's any better?
- That's just not true and you know it.

70
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,360
Your sister's husband happened
to be appointed state treasurer?

71
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,879
Ex-husband. And yes.

72
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,561
That is such
a load of crap, Howard.

73
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:21,440
Gentlemen, Bob is right.

74
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:23,480
This sort of catfighting
gets out in the press,

75
00:05:23,481 --> 00:05:26,160
whichever one of you wins
hits the ground limping.

76
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:31,401
Let's keep it clean and bring some civility
back to the House. Can we agree to that?

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,201
I'd feel a lot better
if you shook hands on it.

78
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:44,521
Thank you.

79
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm with him right now,
Christina.

80
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:55,319
I'm off. I'll swing
by your office later.

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,840
Don't. It's not ready yet.
I'll be working from here.

82
00:05:57,841 --> 00:06:00,039
- What?
- Tusk is in town.

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,360
He's meeting with the president
in 45 minutes. Christina just told me.

84
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,600
- The Joint Commission talks.
- That's what she said.

85
00:06:04,601 --> 00:06:06,959
- Christina's proving useful.
- We'll stay in touch.

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,480
Get me Cathy Durant.
Your people coming by?

87
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:12,840
Just my new chief of staff.
That's all I've got until we hire more.

88
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:16,280
So how's it feel to be married
to the vice president?

89
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:19,880
Exactly
the same... just louder.

90
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,000
Secretary Durant.

91
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:23,120
Cathy.

92
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,481
Raymond.

93
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:31,480
Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

94
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:35,759
Thank you very much.
May I please introduce Secretary Durant.

95
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,240
- A pleasure, Madame Secretary.
- Hi.

96
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:43,880
Well, this is quite a surprise.
I had no idea you were in town.

97
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:46,199
Ah...

98
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,881
Well...

99
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,640
Morning, sir.

100
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,799
- Mr. President.
- Catherine.

101
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,119
- We just happened to run into Raymond.
- Huh!

102
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,281
Wonderful. Come on in.

103
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:17,839
The phone records will
absolutely prove I'm right.

104
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,440
There were no phone records.
You know that.

105
00:07:19,441 --> 00:07:21,240
The data history,
with the carrier.

106
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,280
Even if we got the case reopened,
which isn't gonna happen,

107
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:26,360
you have any idea how hard it
is to get a warrant for phone data?

108
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,920
Probable cause.
Bring him in for questioning.

109
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:31,599
- Technically, you have jurisdiction.
- The vice president?

110
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,560
I know this all sounds preposterous
to you, but if you go through my notes...

111
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:37,800
- We've been through your notes.
- You've listened, but you haven't heard me.

112
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:40,520
Circumstantial,
yes, but plausible.

113
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:43,680
I know you've
reopened cases on less.

114
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:47,040
This has gotta stop, man.
We keep having the same conversation.

115
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,121
It can't be an accident.

116
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:57,359
OK, I'm gonna
show you something.

117
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,199
CNN tried to get ahold of this,
we 86'd it out of respect to the family.

118
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,041
The footage?

119
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:11,000
- It's not easy to watch.
- I want to see it.

120
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,280
She tripped, or jumped.

121
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:23,480
She didn't jump.

122
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,641
Here it is, frame by frame.

123
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:48,320
Now, there were two witnesses.
One was a 70-year-old woman
with macular degeneration.

124
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:50,920
All she saw was a blur.
The second was the conductor of the train.

125
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:53,839
He said it looked like she fell.
Between those two and this video,

126
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,560
that's all there is.

127
00:08:56,561 --> 00:09:02,760
You can watch it a million
times, but this case is closed.

128
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,960
We should limit the agenda
to a couple of key issues:

129
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,199
import tariffs on industrial
manufactured goods,

130
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,279
and export quotas
on rare earth elements.

131
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,760
They're using both
as political levers.

132
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:17,600
I agree these are two areas where we can
make meaningful progress.

133
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:20,399
But I'm worried about the rise
in corporate cyberattacks.

134
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,919
- That's a rabbit hole.
- We have to address it sooner or later.

135
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,280
It's just a matter of whether
we want to address it now.

136
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:32,199
Chinese don't like surprises.
All I'm proposing is that we
use the Joint Commission talks

137
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,040
to bring it up gently now,
set the stage for the next round.

138
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,840
Look, I'm a businessman,
not a diplomat.

139
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:41,000
But I'm a businessman with
35 years' experience working in China.

140
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:43,240
When they come to the table,
you don't get greedy.

141
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:45,999
You're working on a co-venture
refinery project in Fujian.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,959
Which would be
the first of its kind.

143
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,880
Open the gateway
for increased investment...

144
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,439
Cyberattacks
threaten those co-ventures.

145
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,879
There's less a need for them
if the Chinese can obtain new technology

146
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,359
- from corporate espionage.
- Frank, what do you think?

147
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,199
I lean more toward
Raymond's thinking.

148
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,159
If we antagonize the Chinese,
we could undo years of progress.

149
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,719
Allow me to do this quietly, with a
soft touch. I won't antagonize them, sir.

150
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,999
The last thing we want to do
is rock the boat.

151
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,480
What do you have
in mind, Catherine?

152
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:15,599
A suggested agenda,
not a demand.

153
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,439
We'll keep it mid-level.
I won't get anywhere near it.

154
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,721
- Raymond?
- I've voiced my concerns.

155
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,480
- A very soft touch.
- You have my word, sir.

156
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:31,081
Good.

157
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,080
Raymond, you want
to grab some lunch?

158
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,519
- Would love to.
- Thanks, Frank.

159
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,921
- Welcome to the West Wing.
- Thank you, sir.

160
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:52,079
The president is like a lone
tree in an empty field.

161
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,280
He leans whichever way
the wind is blowing.

162
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:58,719
And right now, Raymond Tusk
blows far too strong from the West.

163
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,960
- Is that a wig?
- No.

164
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:04,120
- He's been growing it out for months.
- Here, this way.

165
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,679
Diane says she likes it long.

166
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:12,039
I told her she'll feel differently
once she sees the first dreadlock or...

167
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,000
- ...smells it.
- Oh!

168
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,360
I went to see your
daughter last weekend.

169
00:11:20,841 --> 00:11:22,999
- How is she?
- You want to see a picture?

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,080
OK.

171
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,400
- Was her mother there?
- Yeah.

172
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,759
Are they OK on money?

173
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,999
The rate at Greenwoods
is going up in January.

174
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,159
Catalina's worried
she's gonna be short.

175
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,439
I'll make sure to put
more into the account.

176
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,239
We don't have to talk
about her if you don't want.

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,719
No, no, no, it's fine.
I appreciate you going to see her.

178
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm sorry, Ted, I thought that
when you asked me to lunch,

179
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:50,760
- it was because you...
- No, no, no. I mean... yes.

180
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:55,359
I want to make sure they
have what they need. But no.

181
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,280
The reason I wanted to talk...

182
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,878
- Lorrie Tate.
- Lorrie's a friend of mine.

183
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,959
What about her?

184
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,079
She mentioned you were
interested in the whip's race.

185
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,799
Oh, no.
Oh, I wish she hadn't.

186
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,759
- Why not?
- Because it's ridiculous.

187
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,201
Is it?

188
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:23,159
I just mentioned it offhand.

189
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,800
The whole Webb and Buchwalter
thing, it's just...

190
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:28,399
- Complete mess.
- But I wasn't serious.

191
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,839
I think you should be serious.
Do you want to do it?

192
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,079
I don't have the experience,
Ted. And I don't...

193
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,840
- Yes or no?
- Yes, of course.

194
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:40,599
Someday. But now?
I don't have the money they do.

195
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,079
- Unless you use mine.
- You can't waste your money on...

196
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,919
If I funnel my PAC money
to some folks who are on the fence,

197
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,959
round up a couple dozen
commitments before you announce,

198
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,999
that would make you an instant contender.
Now, tell me that's a waste.

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,039
We're talking
hundreds of thousands.

200
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,440
It's not a Christmas present,
Jackie.

201
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:03,240
With you as whip, I have
a strong ally in the leadership.

202
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:08,639
I stand to gain as much as you.
Now, hang on one second.

203
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,200
I don't know where the...

204
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,840
<i>How did it go?</i>
<i>Did he buy it?</i>

205
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:17,959
Whatever bug you put in his ear,
it burrowed deep.

206
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,600
It was easy. The man adores
you like you're his own child.

207
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:23,279
But you sure as hell better
make me chief deputy.

208
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,559
- I need to win first.
- Ted and I make two, 111 to go.

209
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,200
It's always good when the chief deputy
knows her arithmetic.

210
00:13:30,201 --> 00:13:32,879
Fuck off.
Let's start taking names.

211
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,920
- This one seems promising.
- Connor Ellis. He's solid.

212
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:40,439
- Good experience. - He's the one that
got Senator Jones out of that mess

213
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,799
- with the push-polling.
- Yes. Kept him from the Ethics Committee.

214
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,360
- Let's set up an interview.
- I'll find a good time in the schedule.

215
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:51,279
Let's talk about the schedule.
I think we need to be...

216
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,999
...more selective
with the events I do.

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,279
Some of these are leftovers from
Mrs. Matthews. We can
cancel whatever you like.

218
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,279
And what's this?

219
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,400
Your husband will be pinning stars
on two newly commissioned Marine generals.

220
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:06,600
- I think that's one you should do.
- OK, walk me through it.

221
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:10,319
The generals are Alicia Hampton
and Dalton McGinnis.

222
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,400
- Arriving at 6:50...
- Dalton McGinnis?

223
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:15,720
Yes. Do you know him?

224
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,839
We went to college together.

225
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Um, arrive what time?

226
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:27,639
- Six-fifty.
- Great. I'd like a list

227
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,519
of all the people
that will be attending.

228
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,200
It's not that big a deal
if I get left out,

229
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,240
but you're
the secretary of state.

230
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:36,558
I mean, Tusk should not
be determining policy.

231
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,880
The president alone should
instruct you on what you are to pursue.

232
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,959
- What's their relationship?
- He's has had his ear for years.

233
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,279
- An advisor...
- More of a mentor.

234
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,359
And one whose advice
is not easily dismissed.

235
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,359
He's gonna keep pushing back
on cyberwarfare.

236
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,359
- Not if I get it on the agenda.
- Especially if you get it on the agenda.

237
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,159
Tusk is not gonna
take any chances

238
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,719
when the next Joint Commission
talks come around.

239
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,360
You agreed with him
in the meeting.

240
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:02,120
If we had ganged up, he would've taken
a firmer position.

241
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:05,999
For all we know, he's convincing
the president right now to change his mind.

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,640
Now, we need to remove
that option as a possibility.

243
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:14,799
- How? - Force the Chinese to
confront the issue now,

244
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,079
- this round of talks.
- I promised the president a soft touch.

245
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,200
- I can't intentionally break my promise.
- What if it was unintentional?

246
00:15:24,481 --> 00:15:29,880
Cathy, if you don't like how
the table is set, turn over the table.

247
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,919
- You're cheating.
- No, I'm not. It's vapor.

248
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,680
- Still.
- You should try it.

249
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:44,879
- Addiction without the consequences.
- It's all yours.

250
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,840
You staying up?

251
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,199
This ceremony tomorrow night.

252
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,000
- You don't want to go.
- If I don't have to.

253
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,839
I hate these
sort of things, too,

254
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,440
but it is my first public
appearance as vice president.

255
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,920
- OK.
- Thank you.

256
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,039
Should we turn this
into a proper office?

257
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,719
That's not a bad idea.
No privacy downstairs.

258
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,079
I'll talk to the contractor.

259
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,239
- Good night, Francis.
- Good night.

260
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,160
Sir, sir!<i> Congressional Record.</i>
Weren't the talks supposed to go until six?

261
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:46,880
- We can't talk if they won't listen.
- Did the Chinese walk out?

262
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,919
We made it clear that we won't
discuss any other issues

263
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,599
until government-sponsored
cyberattacks are on the table.

264
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
That's not what
they wanted to hear.

265
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:55,799
Sir, what did you tell the Chinese
delegation before they walked out?

266
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,999
We didn't have anybody there.
The Joint Commission's
usually a snooze fest.

267
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,320
- Not today, it wasn't.
- I've got Greer on it.

268
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,200
Isn't this international?

269
00:17:03,201 --> 00:17:05,079
We need somebody from the tech
beat if we want any background

270
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,959
- on cyberwarfare.
- Does he have anybody on record yet?

271
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,279
The Chinese aren't talking.
And all the US delegation said

272
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,079
- is what's in the AP wire.
- I want something online in two hours.

273
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,800
In-depth follow-up
sometime this week.

274
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,359
Hey, Lucas... you all right?

275
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,239
Yeah, why?

276
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,438
You're wearing the same
clothes you wore yesterday.

277
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,559
Am I?

278
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,319
I don't know what's going on
in your personal life,

279
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,959
but it seems to be entering the
workplace. Appearances matter.

280
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,679
We can't have an editor looking
more disheveled than his reporters.

281
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,319
Two hours.
You'll have something.

282
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,319
Did you know Jackie
Sharp's running for whip?

283
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,439
- No, it's the first I'm hearing of it.
- I spoke to Webb.

284
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,479
He got an e-mail from Lorrie Tate about
me. I got one from Dave Holland about him.

285
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,559
- Which means nothing to me.
- The junkets, the nepotism.

286
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,039
Tate and Sharp are close. Holland serves
on the VA Committee with her.

287
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,599
She used proxies
to insulate herself.

288
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,679
You think she gave
the dirt to them.

289
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,039
- She's been playing both of us.
- How many commitments you think

290
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,239
- she could have?
- Around 20 so far.

291
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,599
- So she's a distant third.
- But she's picking people off us

292
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,598
- left and right. I want your help.
- You have my support, Wes.

293
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,639
- Then make that public. - If I come out
for you, Birch comes out for Webb.

294
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,079
- That's gonna hurt you, not help you.
- This is serious, Frank.

295
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,279
Ted Havemeyer
is bankrolling her.

296
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,119
- Have you thought of talking to Jackie?
- No, no.

297
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,919
- I can't do that on principle.
- Why not?

298
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,918
Anyone who Havemeyer is backing,
I don't work with.

299
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,919
He pulled this same crap on me
when I ran for Senate.

300
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,399
He financed my primary opponent.
Asshole.

301
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,919
Well, that is your call.
But if you're gonna let an old grudge

302
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,160
- get in the way of progress...
- I just can't do it, Frank.

303
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:39,679
Havemeyer's been trying to shove
me down the totem pole for years.

304
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,518
I won't give him
the satisfaction.

305
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,879
Well, I can respect that,
but my hands are tied.

306
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,399
It's a delicate matter, but we are in
communication with the Chinese government

307
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
- as to how to move forward.
- This mean the US will back down

308
00:18:50,601 --> 00:18:52,839
- on cyberattacks?
- The United States never backs down,

309
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,798
particularly on issues
that are high priority to us.

310
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,040
Madame Secretary, what did you
tell the head of the delegation?

311
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:05,199
The delegation
overstepped its bounds.

312
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,479
But Cathy couldn't throw her
own people under the bus.

313
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,999
She should've consulted
us first before speaking publicly.

314
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,719
The press was on her doorstep and
the president was in another hemisphere.

315
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,078
Look, I'm not condoning
what she did, but she had to do something.

316
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,519
She made a gut call
and she acted.

317
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,079
We have to distance
ourselves from this.

318
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,119
- When is the president back?
- Tomorrow morning.

319
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,400
Can we set up a meeting?

320
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:25,119
Cathy needs
to publicly apologize.

321
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,719
We get her in the room
with the president?

322
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,759
Shouldn't we all be
on the same page first?

323
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,639
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

324
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,000
Now, you asked me a question
before I went and got my food

325
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,799
- and I've forgotten what...
- Mr. Vice President. General McGinnis.

326
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,998
Ah. It's a great honor. I hope
you don't mind, the president
wishes he could be here.

327
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:41,038
- He's asked me to fill in.
- The honor is mine, sir.

328
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,959
- And, General, this is my wife Claire.
- It's good to see you, Claire.

329
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,119
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

330
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,879
- Harvard. We were classmates.
- Claire didn't say a thing.

331
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,358
We dated for a time.
Well, about five minutes.

332
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,278
Anyway, I'll let you
get back to your meal.

333
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,599
Thank you. I've remembered.

334
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,760
Interestingly enough, in South Carolinam,
the largest crop is not cotton.

335
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:07,319
No. It's tobacco.
And the third largest crop is marijuana.

336
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,119
Now...

337
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,279
We'll just keep
that to ourselves.

338
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,360
Would you all excuse me
for just a moment?

339
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,959
- Is she alone?
- Yes.

340
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,280
Will you give us
a few moments, please.

341
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,920
What's wrong?

342
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,360
- It was him.
- Who?

343
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
Freshman year.

344
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,600
You mean...?

345
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,638
McGinnis?

346
00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:44,238
Francis. Francis!

347
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:47,079
Please, don't do anything,
please!

348
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,879
I am not gonna pin
a medal on that man.

349
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,559
- You have to!
- Just a minute, please!

350
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,639
- There is no way...
- They want to start.

351
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,600
Just a minute, please!
He does not deserve a medal.

352
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:57,319
- That man needs to be taken out and shot!
- I am begging you. Please!

353
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,159
- No! I said just a minute!
- Do not make a scene!

354
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,120
Please!

355
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,438
Tom.

356
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:37,480
Thanks for coming by.

357
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,520
You know, I thought I would miss
this place the moment I stepped inside...

358
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,640
...but I don't.

359
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,280
Hope you like Stella.

360
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,880
- Cheers.
- Here's how.

361
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:13,080
- How are things?
- Ah! They're good.

362
00:22:14,479 --> 00:22:16,320
They're good.

363
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:21,639
- You're happy?
- I haven't been happy a day in my life.

364
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,318
But I have time now.
To think. To write.

365
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,279
- Been working on a novel.
- Yeah?

366
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,319
Mm. It's absolute shit,
but that's OK.

367
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,279
That's great, Tom.
That's really great.

368
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,599
What's on your mind? I know you
didn't ask me here just to catch up.

369
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,359
Frank Underwood.

370
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,798
On the president's
behalf, it is my great honor

371
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:01,919
to formally recognize
the selection

372
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,999
of General Alicia Hampton
as commander,

373
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,039
United States European Command,

374
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,559
and General Dalton McGinnis
as commander

375
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,999
of the United States
Strategic Command.

376
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,279
The United States Marine Corps
has been well served

377
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,039
by these two...
exemplary leaders.

378
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,480
The president and I are grateful
for their continued service.

379
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,800
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

380
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:15,319
You think I'm insane?

381
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,479
I don't think you're insane.

382
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,719
I think you've been through a lot.
You're trying to make sense of it all.

383
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,559
- I know I'm right.
- I'm sure you believe you are.

384
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,878
It's a fact that he helped
cover up the DUI.

385
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:35,918
Imagine if one of your reporters
came to you with this story.

386
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,438
- Could you print a word of it?
- No, but I'd have them keep digging.

387
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:40,558
Would you? If you're
honest with yourself,

388
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,719
wouldn't you tell them it
seemed far-fetched?

389
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,839
Your notes aren't convincing.
The police reports don't prove a link.

390
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,719
- And the speculative leaps you're making?
- I know.

391
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,000
Hold yourself to the same
standards you hold your staff.

392
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,520
You and Zoe
were seeing each other.

393
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,400
I'm assuming. Maybe I'm wrong.

394
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,439
No, we were.

395
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:21,159
When I lost my first wife,
it didn't add up.

396
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,479
Who dies of breast cancer at 31?

397
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,318
I wanted to sue, doctors,
the hospital, everyone.

398
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,960
I thought they were
hiding something.

399
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:35,158
No.

400
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,840
Grief demands an answer,
but sometimes there isn't one.

401
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:46,400
Her life couldn't be saved.
Period.

402
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,280
What do I do?

403
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,919
Would you consider
seeing someone?

404
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,318
There's a therapist who helped
me when Cynthia passed away.

405
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:57,558
- I can put you in touch with...
- No, I don't need to see somebody.

406
00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:01,679
- Lucas.
- I appreciate you coming by, Tom.

407
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,879
Thanks for the beer.

408
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:08,759
You can call me anytime.

409
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,319
You take care of yourself,
Lucas.

410
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,599
I mean it.

411
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:36,999
Any plans to go elsewhere, sir?

412
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,838
No, we're in
for the night. Thank you.

413
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,520
Yes, sir.

414
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,759
Hey.

415
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
I'm tired.

416
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,119
Do you need something, sir?

417
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,838
My remote, I wanna play.

418
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:48,000
It's right over here.

419
00:27:50,438 --> 00:27:52,239
Thank you.

420
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,997
Something wrong with the
Internet? I can't get online.

421
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:04,520
We had to disable the access.
It's not a secure connection.

422
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,038
Would you just
give me a moment, please?

423
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,718
Whenever you're out here,
somebody needs to be with you.

424
00:28:28,719 --> 00:28:31,958
I can't be alone
in my own backyard?

425
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:35,480
If it were up to me, sir,
but it's not up to me.

426
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,399
OK, Meechum.

427
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,240
You think I don't
want to smash things?

428
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:31,960
I know what that anger is
more than you can imagine.

429
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,838
- When he was on top of me...
- - We don't have to talk about it.

430
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:40,039
No, I want to.

431
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:46,639
When he was on top of me,
I pressed my hand...

432
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:54,678
...with everything I could,
I pressed it into his face.

433
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,119
I pressed it so hard,
I broke his nose.

434
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,359
That didn't stop him.

435
00:30:03,479 --> 00:30:07,799
He shoved the sheets in my
mouth. I could barely breathe.

436
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,798
Every time I think of her,
pinned down like that,

437
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,599
I strangle her, Francis...
so she doesn't strangle me.

438
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,878
I have to.

439
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:30,839
We have to.

440
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,880
The alternative is...

441
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,360
...it's unlivable.

442
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,399
You should go to sleep.

443
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:52,998
I'm not sure if I can.

444
00:30:52,999 --> 00:30:55,959
Then you should
go back downstairs.

445
00:31:11,479 --> 00:31:14,519
You'll still feel
the hate in the morning.

446
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,678
You'll use that.

447
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,159
But not on him.

448
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:33,398
<i>What did you</i>
<i>communicate, exactly?</i>

449
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:37,078
I told him to bring up the agenda,
suggest bullet points for the SED,

450
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,078
- but make no demands. - And how did that
translate into a direct ultimatum?

451
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,519
Well, sometimes my delegates
try to read between the lines.

452
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,838
They know that I need plausible
deniability for diplomatic purposes.

453
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:49,159
Why didn't you
immediately recant?

454
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,838
In my experience with
the Chinese,

455
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:53,438
backpedaling makes us
look weak. I had two choices:

456
00:31:53,439 --> 00:31:57,838
lose face or exhibit strength.
I chose the latter.

457
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,399
- All right, I'll be in touch shortly.
- Thank you, sir.

458
00:32:09,239 --> 00:32:11,839
Get me Raymond
on the private line.

459
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,119
- Think she overstepped on purpose?
- Cathy would never disobey.

460
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,398
- Not on purpose.
- Raymond, I've got Frank here.

461
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:24,718
<i>- Just the three of us?</i>
- Just us three. Morning, Raymond.

462
00:32:24,719 --> 00:32:29,398
My contacts in Beijing tell me
the minister of commerce is in a tizzy.

463
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,639
<i>Wants to use this as an excuse</i>
<i>to start clenching fists.</i>

464
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,958
Either I turn my back on Cathy
or I stand behind her.

465
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:37,998
<i>- It's got to be the former.</i>
- I agree. If you don't apologize,

466
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:40,718
<i>you go from ruffling feathers</i>
<i>to plucking them.</i>

467
00:32:40,719 --> 00:32:42,958
And the Chinese won't
stand for that, Mr. President.

468
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:45,238
What about perceived miscommunication
between me and my Cabinet?

469
00:32:45,239 --> 00:32:48,238
<i>Mr. President, right now
the goal is to resume the talks.</i>

470
00:32:48,239 --> 00:32:50,198
I wouldn't worry
about perceptions.

471
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,798
<i>Frank is right.</i>
<i>We need to be pragmatic.</i>

472
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,799
Worry about appearances later.

473
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,438
All right, I'll have Catherine
draft an apology.

474
00:32:59,439 --> 00:33:01,959
No, it has to come
from you, Mr. President.

475
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,798
If the apology is to mean anything,
it must come from the White House.

476
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,359
That is certainly
the more likely to succeed.

477
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,958
Fine. I'll do it, then.

478
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:14,880
<i>- Thank you, Raymond.</i>
- Thank you, Garrett.

479
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,958
Do you hear how he still
uses the President's given name?

480
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:24,360
And that Walker doesn't flinch
at the lack of respect it implies?

481
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:31,199
Sir, forgive me if this isn't
the case, but you seem a bit hesitant.

482
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,998
- Why do you say that?
- Well, you've raised a good point

483
00:33:33,999 --> 00:33:36,278
about public perception.
I don't want you to think

484
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:40,238
- that I'm dismissing your concerns
casually. - It's a concern for you, too?

485
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:45,600
- There is some insight into what Cathy
brought up. - Backpedaling as weakness.

486
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,318
Well, it's always a coin toss
with the Chinese.

487
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,998
But sometimes, standing your
ground is better than giving in.

488
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,157
They respect you more
when you show strength.

489
00:33:58,158 --> 00:34:01,238
Are you changing
your mind on this, Frank?

490
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:05,599
I just think it's important
that you do what you think is best.

491
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,319
The American people voted you
president, not me, not Raymond Tusk.

492
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,159
- I'll let you know what I decide.
- Thank you, sir.

493
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,878
You think she's
Underwood's choice?

494
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,999
He deflected, so it's possible.

495
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:35,678
You and I, we need
to work together on this, Wes.

496
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,559
- Before we both get screwed.
- I agree.

497
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:45,758
One of us drops out,
throws support to the other.

498
00:34:45,759 --> 00:34:48,278
That'll dwarf
any following she has.

499
00:34:48,279 --> 00:34:51,318
You want me to drop out.

500
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:53,599
I'll make sure you get my
chairmanship on Appropriations.

501
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,959
All you can offer me is Ethics,
which nobody wants.

502
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:06,759
Let's put this to bed, Wes.

503
00:35:09,919 --> 00:35:11,719
Webb must have
offered him a deal.

504
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,158
Then we have
to offer a better one.

505
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,638
I'm guessing Appropriations.

506
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,917
There's no way I can top that.

507
00:35:15,918 --> 00:35:17,559
Except for Ways and Means.

508
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:23,278
I won't let you give your chair
to an ass like Buchwalter.

509
00:35:23,279 --> 00:35:25,958
If you're the whip, you outrank
him and every other chairman.

510
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:28,958
Screw committees. I'll have a
direct line to the Speaker.

511
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:32,798
- Don't be stubborn, Jackie.
- You think he'd take it?

512
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:34,438
He was willing
to take a deal from Webb.

513
00:35:34,439 --> 00:35:36,918
You're the only person
he hates more.

514
00:35:36,919 --> 00:35:41,038
He's a brute,
but he's not an idiot.

515
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,838
Well, I know you're not
refusing out of loyalty.

516
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:54,959
- True.
- So it's because of Ted.

517
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,398
You think you are hot shit,
don't you?

518
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:05,878
Can we set egos aside and
talk business like the adults we are?

519
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,118
- I want more than Ways and Means.
- Tell me.

520
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,039
I want Havemeyer gone.
Not just retired...

521
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,798
...politically dead.

522
00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:23,838
That race was 12 years ago.

523
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,317
That was 12 years
I could've been in the Senate.

524
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:31,078
Revenge? Really?

525
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,319
Not revenge.

526
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:36,519
Equity.

527
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:41,677
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Buchwalter won't budge.

528
00:36:41,678 --> 00:36:45,758
You know, there's nothing
I despise more in life than pettiness.

529
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:48,638
I could approach Webb,
but I don't have enough to offer him.

530
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:51,917
He'd never drop out.
Too much pride.

531
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,318
- I'm not sure what to do.
- This is my file on Ted.

532
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:58,278
An illegitimate daughter.
The nanny, of course.

533
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:01,998
Her name is Emily Rodriguez.
Nineteen, cerebral palsy.

534
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:04,039
I know about Emily.

535
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,398
- Why are we having this conversation?
- It's complicated.

536
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:12,438
The daughter? It's very
black-and-white to me.

537
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:16,638
I've known Ted since I was born.
He and my father were very close.

538
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:19,518
- Yeah, I'm aware.
- He's always looked out for me.

539
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:22,118
He got me into West Point.
He funded my first race.

540
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:24,238
I like Ted. He's always
been a team player.

541
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:26,758
- It's unfortunate he has this secret.
- It was a mistake.

542
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:29,038
One he's always regretted.
After she was born,

543
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:31,678
he asked me to check in on her
because he couldn't.

544
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,678
- Because he trusted me.
- I see.

545
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:39,798
You came in here knowing
what you had to do,

546
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:42,478
hoping I would pull a rabbit
out of a hat so you wouldn't have to.

547
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:47,399
I know the girl. I know her mother.
These people don't deserve this.

548
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,438
I've given you all I can.
Whatever you decide is your prerogative.

549
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:54,918
- But maybe I misjudged you.
- Ted is family to me.

550
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:58,518
An adopted daughter,
in lieu of a real one.

551
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:01,357
- Sir, the secretary is here.
- Thank you. Send her in.

552
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:03,639
Excuse us.

553
00:38:13,678 --> 00:38:15,477
- It's good.
- Not too long?

554
00:38:15,478 --> 00:38:17,677
A little bit, but not much.

555
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:21,838
- This part, three paragraphs in.
- About the phone companies?

556
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:25,077
- Tell me more. - It's one of
Homeland Security's major concerns.

557
00:38:25,078 --> 00:38:27,638
That the cyberattacks might
infiltrate phone carriers,

558
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,877
get access to millions
of people's data history.

559
00:38:29,878 --> 00:38:32,158
- Like who they called?
- Yeah. Who they called, texted,

560
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,118
what they texted, when,
where they were. Everything.

561
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,038
- And that's possible? - There haven't been
any catastrophic breaches yet.

562
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,598
At least not reported.
But it looks like the Chinese are starting

563
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,198
to recruit mercenaries on the Deep Web
to launch guerilla-type attacks

564
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:46,598
- that can't be traced back...
- Hold on. The "Deep Web."

565
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,278
- I've heard of that.
- Yeah, no, 96 percent of the Internet

566
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:52,158
isn't accessible through standard
search engines. Most of it's useless.

567
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,078
But it's where you go to find
anything and everything:

568
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,238
child porn, bitcoin laundering,
mail-order narcotics, hackers for hire.

569
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,758
- How do you access it?
- It's actually pretty easy.

570
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:04,158
- I could show you if you want.
- Yeah, I'm curious.

571
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:06,198
- Mind if I...?
- Go ahead.

572
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,998
First thing you need's Tor.

573
00:39:07,999 --> 00:39:11,117
Some people prefer I2P,
but I think Tor is better.

574
00:39:11,118 --> 00:39:15,917
- What is Tor? - Protects you through
proxy servers, keeps you anonymous.

575
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,278
Then I'll show how to get
to the posting boards and the IRCs.

576
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:23,797
But I gotta warn you, be careful
what you click. Some crazy shit there, man.

577
00:39:23,798 --> 00:39:27,637
For too long,
we've danced on eggshells

578
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:30,517
regarding the issue
of cyberwarfare.

579
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:36,678
<i>Secretary Durant acted on instructions</i>
<i>that came directly from me.</i>

580
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:39,638
<i>Now, if the Chinese are not willing
to engage in a meaningful dialogue</i>

581
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:42,118
<i>about intellectual property</i>
<i>of American corporations,</i>

582
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,478
<i>as well as this deliberate targeting of
our government's online infrastructure,</i>

583
00:39:46,479 --> 00:39:49,118
<i>well, then that is proof</i>
<i>of a double-standard mentality</i>

584
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,158
<i>that we shall</i>
<i>no longer tolerate.</i>

585
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,878
<i>Our delegation to the Joint Commission</i>
<i>on Commerce and Trade</i>

586
00:39:54,879 --> 00:39:58,157
<i>was unfairly accused and defamed</i>

587
00:39:58,158 --> 00:40:01,997
<i>by representatives of the</i>
<i>United States government.</i>

588
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:03,878
<i>The People's Republic of China</i>

589
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:09,118
<i>will not be threatened by
derisive and unsubstantiated claims.</i>

590
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,078
<i>As long as the White House</i>
<i>continues to behave this way,</i>

591
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:17,918
<i>any future bilateral trade</i>
<i>talks will be impossible.</i>

592
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,757
It caught me by surprise, too.

593
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:22,678
Did you say anything to him
after I hung up yesterday?

594
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:25,798
- No. Have you spoken to him?
- <i> A few minutes ago.</i>

595
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:27,997
He said he did
what he thought was right.

596
00:40:27,998 --> 00:40:30,157
<i>Well, there's nothing</i>
<i>we can do to combat that.</i>

597
00:40:30,158 --> 00:40:34,038
He doesn't usually go against
my advice without giving me fair warning.

598
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:38,797
- What are you suggesting, Raymond?
- He's easily manipulated.

599
00:40:38,798 --> 00:40:41,517
- Clearly, not in this case.
- <i> We need to fix this.</i>

600
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:44,878
<i>- And I'm counting on you for that, Frank.</i>
- Let me freshen your memory.

601
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:48,998
<i>I don't owe you any favors.</i>
<i>I promised to work with you, not for you.</i>

602
00:40:48,999 --> 00:40:51,198
And when it comes to China,
we both want the same thing.

603
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,558
- So we need to work together.
<i>- To convince Garrett he should retract.</i>

604
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,717
To support the president
in the path that he's chosen.

605
00:40:56,718 --> 00:40:59,358
While he continues
to antagonize them publicly.

606
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:02,158
While he continues to benefit
from a bump in approval ratings.

607
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,477
<i>A tough stance on China is popular,
and we can use that to our advantage.</i>

608
00:41:06,478 --> 00:41:09,438
<i>Let's just be patient and see if we can
smooth things over from back channels.</i>

609
00:41:09,439 --> 00:41:12,198
If I don't see any results,
you won't have my patience for long.

610
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:16,838
- That's understood.
- Let me know what Durant has to say.

611
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:20,039
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

612
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,957
I thought he might balk
at taking a handout from me.

613
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:28,757
I'd call it more than a handout.

614
00:41:28,758 --> 00:41:33,478
Well, he's always been the sort of man
who could be bought,

615
00:41:33,479 --> 00:41:35,757
but never cheaply.

616
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:39,398
It's not the chairmanship
that bought him, Ted.

617
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:41,357
What do you mean?

618
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:44,558
I'm telling you this so that
you have time to call your wife

619
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,638
and prepare your statement.

620
00:41:53,718 --> 00:41:56,717
What's my out?
What's he want from me?

621
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:59,359
There is no out.
He wants it to hurt.

622
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,518
- You told him?
- I just promised him

623
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:06,957
- that I could make it happen.
- You can't do this, Jackie.

624
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,877
The story's breaking tomorrow.

625
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:13,638
- What part of it?
- No names. Just that you have a daughter.

626
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:17,037
Have you thought about
what this will do to Diane?

627
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:20,958
- To our sons?
- I hate myself for it.

628
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:24,077
- But I'll get over that.
- What about her?

629
00:42:24,078 --> 00:42:28,077
- Emily? You can't even say
her name, can you? - Don't lecture me.

630
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,598
You've never been
in the same room with her.

631
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,917
She's had the best
treatment available.

632
00:42:31,918 --> 00:42:33,918
Alone. Hooked up
to machines.

633
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:36,318
Surrounded by nurses
who punch out at dinnertime.

634
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,038
- You don't know what I've been through.
- You? What about her?

635
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:43,038
- I can't do more than I've done.
- That's bullshit, Ted.

636
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:45,517
- You could've found a way.
- I won't defend myself to you.

637
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:48,118
Don't. Save that
for your wife.

638
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:55,358
This isn't to punish you, Ted.
It's simpler than that.

639
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,318
When I first encouraged
you to run for office,

640
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:01,078
it's because I sensed
how unstoppable you were.

641
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:06,598
But I never thought I'd have
to lie down on the tracks myself.

642
00:43:07,879 --> 00:43:11,277
If you're going to put
my neck in the noose,

643
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:15,318
look me in the eye
while you do it.

644
00:43:23,278 --> 00:43:26,677
I'm very grateful
for all that you've done for me.

645
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:29,478
You'll make an excellent
whip, Jacqueline.

646
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:32,439
Now, please
get out of my office.

647
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,439
What are you doing?

648
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:52,799
Sh, sh, sh, sh!

649
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:03,318
It's finally quiet.

650
00:44:05,797 --> 00:44:09,518
It is, isn't it?

651
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:13,158
We have our fortress now.

652
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:16,318
- Where are you coming from?
- My new office.

653
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,758
You just finished
setting it up today.

654
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:22,479
- Do you like it?
- It's an office. It's fine.

655
