A scala parser for .srt (subtitles) files.

This parser is able to read not only the .srt files that respect the syntax, but also the real-life .srt files found on the web which may sometimes have a very loose interpretation of the syntax.
The parser is successfully tested against a set 440+ .srt files coming from various sources and for various medias.
